      '\n' +
      'An important paradigm of natural language processing consists of large-scale pre-training on general domain data and adaptation to particular tasks or domains. As we pre-train larger models, full fine-tuning, which retrains all model parameters, becomes less feasible. Using GPT-3 175B as an example - deploying independent instances of fine-tuned models, each with 175B parameters, is prohibitively expensive. We propose **Lo**w-**R**ank **A**daptation, or LoRA, which freezes the pre-trained model weights and injects trainable rank decomposition matrices into each layer of the Transformer architecture, greatly reducing the number of trainable parameters for downstream tasks. Compared to GPT-3 175B fine-tuned with Adam, LoRA can reduce the number of trainable parameters by 10,000 times and the GPU memory requirement by 3 times. LoRA performs on-par or better than fine-tuning in model quality on RoBERTa, DeBERTa, GPT-2, and GPT-3, despite having fewer trainable parameters, a higher training throughput, and, unlike adapters, _no additional inference latency_. We also provide an empirical investigation into rank-deficiency in language model adaptation, which sheds light on the efficacy of LoRA. We release a package that facilitates the integration of LoRA with PyTorch models and provide our implementations and model checkpoints for RoBERTa, DeBERTa, and GPT-2 at [https://github.com/microsoft/LoRA](https://github.com/microsoft/LoRA).\n' +

      '## 1 Introduction\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Many applications in natural language processing rely on adapting _one_ large-scale, pre-trained language model to _multiple_ downstream applications. Such adaptation is usually done via _fine-tuning_, which updates all the parameters of the pre-trained model. The major downside of fine-tuning is that the new model contains as many parameters as in the original model. As larger models are trained every few months, this changes from a mere "inconvenience" for GPT-2 (Radford et al., b) or RoBERTa large (Liu et al., 2019) to a critical deployment challenge for GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) with 175 billion trainable parameters.1\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Footnote 1: While GPT-3 175B achieves non-trivial performance with few-shot learning, fine-tuning boosts its performance significantly as shown in Appendix A.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Many sought to mitigate this by adapting only some parameters or learning external modules for new tasks. This way, we only need to store and load a small number of task-specific parameters in addition to the pre-trained model for each task, greatly boosting the operational efficiency when deployed. However, existing techniques\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Figure 1: Our reparametrization. We only train \\(A\\) and \\(B\\).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'often introduce inference latency (Houlsby et al., 2019; Rebuffi et al., 2017) by extending model depth or reduce the model\'s usable sequence length (Li and Liang, 2021; Lester et al., 2021; Hambardzumyan et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2021) (Section 3). More importantly, these method often fail to match the fine-tuning baselines, posing a trade-off between efficiency and model quality.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We take inspiration from Li et al. (2018); Aghajanyan et al. (2020) which show that the learned over-parametrized models in fact reside on a low intrinsic dimension. We hypothesize that the change in weights during model adaptation also has a low "intrinsic rank", leading to our proposed **Low-Rank A**daptation (LoRA) approach. LoRA allows us to train some dense layers in a neural network indirectly by optimizing rank decomposition matrices of the dense layers\' change during adaptation instead, while keeping the pre-trained weights frozen, as shown in Figure 1. Using GPT-3 175B as an example, we show that a very low rank (i.e., \\(r\\) in Figure 1 can be one or two) suffices even when the full rank (i.e., \\(d\\)) is as high as 12,288, making LoRA both storage- and compute-efficient.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'LoRA possesses several key advantages.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '* A pre-trained model can be shared and used to build many small LoRA modules for different tasks. We can freeze the shared model and efficiently switch tasks by replacing the matrices \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) in Figure 1, reducing the storage requirement and task-switching overhead significantly.\n' +
      '* LoRA makes training more efficient and lowers the hardware barrier to entry by up to 3 times when using adaptive optimizers since we do not need to calculate the gradients or maintain the optimizer states for most parameters. Instead, we only optimize the injected, much smaller low-rank matrices.\n' +
      '* Our simple linear design allows us to merge the trainable matrices with the frozen weights when deployed, _introducing no inference latency_ compared to a fully fine-tuned model, by construction.\n' +
      '* LoRA is orthogonal to many prior methods and can be combined with many of them, such as prefix-tuning. We provide an example in Appendix E.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Terminologies and ConventionsWe make frequent references to the Transformer architecture and use the conventional terminologies for its dimensions. We call the input and output dimension size of a Transformer layer \\(d_{model}\\). We use \\(W_{q}\\), \\(W_{k}\\), \\(W_{v}\\), and \\(W_{o}\\) to refer to the query/key/value/output projection matrices in the self-attention module. \\(W\\) or \\(W_{0}\\) refers to a pre-trained weight matrix and \\(\\Delta W\\) its accumulated gradient update during adaptation. We use \\(r\\) to denote the rank of a LoRA module. We follow the conventions set out by (Vaswani et al., 2017; Brown et al., 2020) and use Adam (Loshchilov and Hutter, 2019; Kingma and Ba, 2017) for model optimization and use a Transformer MLP feedforward dimension \\(d_{ffn}=4\\times d_{model}\\).\n' +
      '\n' +
      '## 2 Problem Statement\n' +
      '\n' +
      'While our proposal is agnostic to training objective, we focus on language modeling as our motivating use case. Below is a brief description of the language modeling problem and, in particular, the maximization of conditional probabilities given a task-specific prompt.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Suppose we are given a pre-trained autoregressive language model \\(P_{\\Phi}(y|x)\\) parametrized by \\(\\Phi\\). For instance, \\(P_{\\Phi}(y|x)\\) can be a generic multi-task learner such as GPT (Radford et al., b; Brown et al., 2020) based on the Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017). Consider adapting this pre-trained model to downstream conditional text generation tasks, such as summarization, machine reading comprehension (MRC), and natural language to SQL (NL2SQL). Each downstream task is represented by a training dataset of context-target pairs: \\(\\mathcal{Z}=\\{(x_{i},y_{i})\\}_{i=1,..,N}\\), where both \\(x_{i}\\) and \\(y_{i}\\) are sequences of tokens. For example, in NL2SQL, \\(x_{i}\\) is a natural language query and \\(y_{i}\\) its corresponding SQL command; for summarization, \\(x_{i}\\) is the content of an article and \\(y_{i}\\) its summary.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'During full fine-tuning, the model is initialized to pre-trained weights \\(\\Phi_{0}\\) and updated to \\(\\Phi_{0}+\\Delta\\Phi\\) by repeatedly following the gradient to maximize the conditional language modeling objective:\n' +
      '\n' +
      '\\[\\max_{\\Phi}\\sum_{(x,y)\\in\\mathcal{Z}}\\sum_{t=1}^{|y|}\\text{log}\\left(P_{\\Phi}(y_ {t}|x,y_{<t})\\right) \\tag{1}\\]\n' +
      '\n' +
      'One of the main drawbacks for full fine-tuning is that for _each_ downstream task, we learn a _different_ set of parameters \\(\\Delta\\Phi\\) whose dimension \\(|\\Delta\\Phi|\\) equals \\(|\\Phi_{0}|\\). Thus, if the pre-trained model is large (such as GPT-3 with \\(|\\Phi_{0}|\\approx 175\\) Billion), storing and deploying many independent instances of fine-tuned models can be challenging, if at all feasible.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In this paper, we adopt a more parameter-efficient approach, where the task-specific parameter increment \\(\\Delta\\Phi=\\Delta\\Phi(\\Theta)\\) is further encoded by a much smaller-sized set of parameters \\(\\Theta\\) with \\(|\\Theta|\\ll|\\Phi_{0}|\\). The task of finding \\(\\Delta\\Phi\\) thus becomes optimizing over \\(\\Theta\\):\n' +
      '\n' +
      '\\[\\max_{\\Theta}\\sum_{(x,y)\\in\\mathcal{Z}}\\sum_{t=1}^{|y|}\\text{log}\\left(p_{ \\Phi_{0}+\\Delta\\Phi(\\Theta)}(y_{t}|x,y_{<t})\\right) \\tag{2}\\]\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In the subsequent sections, we propose to use a low-rank representation to encode \\(\\Delta\\Phi\\) that is both compute- and memory-efficient. When the pre-trained model is GPT-3 175B, the number of trainable parameters \\(|\\Theta|\\) can be as small as \\(0.01\\%\\) of \\(|\\Phi_{0}|\\).\n' +
      '\n' +
      '## 3 Aren\'t Existing Solutions Good Enough?\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The problem we set out to tackle is by no means new. Since the inception of transfer learning, dozens of works have sought to make model adaptation more parameter- and compute-efficient. See Section 6 for a survey of some of the well-known works. Using language modeling as an example, there are two prominent strategies when it comes to efficient adaptations: adding adapter layers (Houlsby et al., 2019; Rebuffi et al., 2017; Pfeiffer et al., 2021; Ruckle et al., 2020) or optimizing some forms of the input layer activations (Li and Liang, 2021; Lester et al., 2021; Hambardzumyan et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2021). However, both strategies have their limitations, especially in a large-scale and latency-sensitive production scenario.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Adapter Layers Introduce Inference LatencyThere are many variants of adapters. We focus on the original design by Houlsby et al. (2019) which has two adapter layers per Transformer block and a more recent one by Lin et al. (2020) which has only one per block but with an additional LayerNorm (Ba et al., 2016). While one can reduce the overall latency by pruning layers or exploiting multi-task settings (Ruckle et al., 2020; Pfeiffer et al., 2021), there is no direct ways to bypass the extra compute in adapter layers. This seems like a non-issue since adapter layers are designed to have few parameters (sometimes \\(<\\)1% of the original model) by having a small bottleneck dimension, which limits the FLOPs they can add. However, large neural networks rely on hardware parallelism to keep the latency low, and adapter layers have to be processed sequentially. This makes a difference in the online inference setting where the batch size is typically as small as one. In a generic scenario without model parallelism, such as running inference on GPT-2 (Radford et al., b) medium on a single GPU, we see a noticeable increase in latency when using adapters, even with a very small bottleneck dimension (Table 1).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'This problem gets worse when we need to shard the model as done in Shoeybi et al. (2020); Lepikhin et al. (2020), because the additional depth requires more synchronous GPU operations such as AllReduce and Broadcast, unless we store the adapter parameters redundantly many times.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Directly Optimizing the Prompt is HardThe other direction, as exemplified by prefix tuning (Li and Liang, 2021), faces a different challenge. We observe that prefix tuning is difficult to optimize and that its performance changes non-monotonically in trainable parameters, confirming similar observations in the original paper. More fundamentally, reserving a part of the sequence length for adaptation necessarily reduces the sequence length available to process a downstream task, which we suspect makes tuning the prompt less performant compared to other methods. We defer the study on task performance to Section 5.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '## 4 Our Method\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We describe the simple design of LoRA and its practical benefits. The principles outlined here apply to any dense layers in deep learning models, though we only focus on certain weights in Transformer language models in our experiments as the motivating use case.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### Low-Rank-Parametrized Update Matrices\n' +
      '\n' +
      'A neural network contains many dense layers which perform matrix multiplication. The weight matrices in these layers typically have full-rank. When adapting to a specific task, Aghajanyan et al. (2020) shows that the pre-trained language models have a low "instrisic dimension" and can still learn efficiently despite a random projection to a smaller subspace. Inspired by this, we hypothesize the updates to the weights also have a low "intrinsic rank" during adaptation. For a pre-trained weight matrix \\(W_{0}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d\\times k}\\), we constrain its update by representing the latter with a low-rank decomposition \\(W_{0}+\\Delta W=W_{0}+BA\\), where \\(B\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d\\times r}\\), \\(A\\in\\mathbb{R}^{r\\times k}\\), and the rank \\(r\\ll\\min(d,k)\\). During training, \\(W_{0}\\) is frozen and does not receive gradient updates, while \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) contain trainable parameters. Note both \\(W_{0}\\) and \\(\\Delta W=BA\\) are multiplied with the same input, and their respective output vectors are summed coordinate-wise. For \\(h=W_{0}x\\), our modified forward pass yields:\n' +
      '\n' +
      '\\[h=W_{0}x+\\Delta Wx=W_{0}x+BAx \\tag{3}\\]\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We illustrate our reparametrization in Figure 1. We use a random Gaussian initialization for \\(A\\) and zero for \\(B\\), so \\(\\Delta W=BA\\) is zero at the beginning of training. We then scale \\(\\Delta Wx\\) by \\(\\frac{\\alpha}{r}\\), where \\(\\alpha\\) is a constant in \\(r\\). When optimizing with Adam, tuning \\(\\alpha\\) is roughly the same as tuning the learning rate if we scale the initialization appropriately. As a result, we simply set \\(\\alpha\\) to the first \\(r\\) we try and do not tune it. This scaling helps to reduce the need to retune hyperparameters when we vary \\(r\\)(Yang and Hu, 2021).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'A Generalization of Full Fine-tuning.A more general form of fine-tuning allows the training of a subset of the pre-trained parameters. LoRA takes a step further and does not require the accumulated gradient update to weight matrices to have full-rank during adaptation. This means that when applying LoRA to all weight matrices and training all biases2, we roughly recover the expressiveness of full fine-tuning by setting the LoRA rank \\(r\\) to the rank of the pre-trained weight matrices. In other words, as we increase the number of trainable parameters 3, training LoRA roughly converges to training the original model, while adapter-based methods converges to an MLP and prefix-based methods to a model that cannot take long input sequences.\n' +

Note that both \\(W_{0}\\) and \\(BA\\) are in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{d\\times k}\\). When we need to switch to another downstream task, we can recover \\(W_{0}\\) by subtracting \\(BA\\) and then adding a different \\(B^{\\prime}A^{\\prime}\\), a quick operation with very little memory overhead.

      '### Applying LoRA to Transformer\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In principle, we can apply LoRA to any subset of weight matrices in a neural network to reduce the number of trainable parameters. In the Transformer architecture, there are four weight matrices in the self-attention module (\\(W_{q},W_{k},W_{v},W_{o}\\)) and two in the MLP module. We treat \\(W_{q}\\) (or \\(W_{k},W_{v}\\)) as a single matrix of dimension \\(d_{model}\\times d_{model}\\), **even** though the output dimension is usually sliced into attention heads. We limit our study to **only adapting the attention weights** for downstream tasks and freeze the MLP modules (so they are not trained in downstream tasks) both for simplicity and parameter-efficiency.We further study the effect on adapting different types of attention weight matrices in a Transformer in Section 7.1. We leave the empirical investigation of adapting the MLP layers, LayerNorm layers, and biases to a future work.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Practical Benefits and Limitations.The most significant benefit comes from the reduction in memory and storage usage. For a large Transformer trained with Adam, we reduce that VRAM usage by up to \\(2/3\\) if \\(r\\ll d_{model}\\) as we do not need to store the optimizer states for the frozen parameters. On GPT-3 175B, we reduce the VRAM consumption during training from 1.2TB to 350GB. With \\(r=4\\) and only the query and value projection matrices being adapted, the checkpoint size is reduced by roughly 10,000\\(\\times\\) (from 350GB to 35MB)4. This allows us to train with significantly fewer GPUs and avoid I/O bottlenecks. Another benefit is that we can switch between tasks while deployed at a much lower cost by only swapping the LoRA weights as opposed to all the parameters. This allows for the creation of many customized models that can be swapped in and out on the fly on machines that store the pre-trained weights in VRAM. We also observe a 25% speedup during training on GPT-3 175B compared to full fine-tuning5 as we do not need to calculate the gradient for the vast majority of the parameters.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Footnote 4: We still need the 350GB model during deployment; however, storing 100 adapted models only requires 350GB + 35MB * 100 \\(\\approx\\) 354GB as opposed to 100 * 350GB \\(\\approx\\) 35TB.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Footnote 5: For GPT-3 175B, the training throughput for full fine-tuning is 32.5 tokens/s per V100 GPU; with the same number of weight shards for model parallelism, the throughput is 43.1 tokens/s per V100 GPU for LoRA.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'LoRA also has its limitations. For example, it is not straightforward to batch inputs to different tasks with different \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) in a single forward pass, if one chooses to absorb \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) into \\(W\\) to eliminate additional inference latency. Though it is possible to not merge the weights and dynamically choose the LoRA modules to use for samples in a batch for scenarios where latency is not critical.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '## 5 Empirical Experiments\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We evaluate the downstream task performance of LoRA on RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019), DeBERTa (He et al., 2021), and GPT-2 (Radford et al., b), before scaling up to GPT-3 175B (Brown et al., 2020). Our experiments cover a wide range of tasks, from natural language understanding (NLU) to generation (NLG). Specifically, we evaluate on the GLUE (Wang et al., 2019) benchmark for RoBERTa and DeBERTa. We follow the setup of Li and Liang (2021) on GPT-2 for a direct comparison and add WikiSQL (Zhong et al., 2017) (NL to SQL queries) and SAMSum (Gliwa et al., 2019) (conversation summarization) for large-scale experiments on GPT-3. See Appendix C for more details on the datasets we use. We use NVIDIA Tesla V100 for all experiments.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### Baselines\n' +
      '\n' +
      'To compare with other baselines broadly, we replicate the setups used by prior work and reuse their reported numbers whenever possible. This, however, means that some baselines might only appear in certain experiments.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Fine-Tuning (FT)** is a common approach for adaptation. During fine-tuning, the model is initialized to the pre-trained weights and biases, and all model parameters undergo gradient updates.A simple variant is to update only some layers while freezing others. We include one such baseline reported in prior work (Li and Liang, 2021) on GPT-2, which adapts just the last two layers (**FT\\({}^{\\textbf{Top2}}\\)**).\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Bias-only or BitFit** is a baseline where we only train the bias vectors while freezing everything else. Contemporarily, this baseline has also been studied by BitFit (Zaken et al., 2021).\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Prefix-embedding tuning (PreEmbed)** inserts special tokens among the input tokens. These special tokens have trainable word embeddings and are generally not in the model\'s vocabulary. Where to place such tokens can have an impact on performance. We focus on "prefixing", which prepends such tokens to the prompt, and "infixing", which appends to the prompt; both are discussed in Li and Liang (2021). We use \\(l_{p}\\) (resp. \\(l_{i}\\)) denote the number of prefix (resp. infix) tokens. The number of trainable parameters is \\(|\\Theta|=d_{model}\\times(l_{p}+l_{i})\\).\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Prefix-layer tuning (PreLayer)** is an extension to prefix-embedding tuning. Instead of just learning the word embeddings (or equivalently, the activations after the embedding layer) for some special tokens, we learn the activations after every Transformer layer. The activations computed from previous layers are simply replaced by trainable ones. The resulting number of trainable parameters is \\(|\\Theta|=L\\times d_{model}\\times(l_{p}+l_{i})\\), where \\(L\\) is the number of Transformer layers.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Adapter tuning** as proposed in Houlsby et al. (2019) inserts adapter layers between the self-attention module (and the MLP module) and the subsequent residual connection. There are two fully connected layers with biases in an adapter layer with a nonlinearity in between. We call this original design \\(\\textbf{Adapter}^{\\textbf{H}}\\). Recently, Lin et al. (2020) proposed a more efficient design with the adapter layer applied only after the MLP module and after a LayerNorm. We call it \\(\\textbf{Adapter}^{\\textbf{L}}\\). This is very similar to another design proposed in Pfeiffer et al. (2021), which we call \\(\\textbf{Adapter}^{\\textbf{P}}\\). We also include another baseline call AdapterDrop (Ruckle et al., 2020) which drops some adapter layers for greater efficiency (\\(\\textbf{Adapter}^{\\textbf{P}}\\)). We cite numbers from prior works whenever possible to maximize the number of baselines we compare with; they are in rows with an asterisk (*) in the first column. In all cases, we have \\(|\\Theta|=\\hat{L}_{Adpt}\\times(2\\times d_{model}\\times r+r+d_{model})+2\\times \\hat{L}_{LN}\\times d_{model}\\) where \\(\\hat{L}_{Adpt}\\) is the number of adapter layers and \\(\\hat{L}_{LN}\\) the number of trainable LayerNorms (e.g., in Adapter\\({}^{\\textbf{L}}\\)).\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**LoRA** adds trainable pairs of rank decomposition matrices in parallel to existing weight matrices. As mentioned in Section 4.2, we only apply LoRA to \\(W_{q}\\) and \\(W_{v}\\) in most experiments for simplicity. The number of trainable parameters is determined by the rank \\(r\\) and the shape of the original weights: \\(|\\Theta|=2\\times\\hat{L}_{LoRA}\\times d_{model}\\times r\\), where \\(\\hat{L}_{LoRA}\\) is the number of weight matrices we apply LoRA to\n' +

While RoBERTa has been overtaken by much larger models on NLP leaderboards such as the GLUE benchmark Wang et al. (2019) in recent years, it remains a competitive and popular pre-trained model for its size among practitioners. We take the pre-trained RoBERTa base (125M) and RoBERTa large (355M) from the HuggingFace Transformers library Wolf et al. (2020) and evaluate the performance of different efficient adaptation approaches on tasks from the GLUE benchmark. We also replicate Houlsby et al. (2019) and Pfeiffer et al. (2021) according to their setup. To ensure a fair comparison, we make two crucial changes to how we evaluate LoRA when comparing with adapters. First, we use the same batch size for all tasks and use a sequence length of 128 to match the adapter baselines. Second, we initialize the model to the pre-trained model for MRPC, RTE, and STS-B, not a model already adapted to MNLI like the fine-tuning baseline. Runs following this more restricted setup from Houlsby et al. (2019) are labeled with \\(\\dagger\\). The result is presented in Table 2 (Top Three Sections).

      'Prompt Engineering and Fine-Tuning.While GPT-3 175B can adapt its behavior with just a few additional training examples, the result depends heavily on the input prompt (Brown et al., 2020). This necessitates an empirical art of composing and formatting the prompt to maximize a model\'s performance on a desired task, which is known as prompt engineering or prompt hacking. Fine-tuning retrains a model pre-trained on general domains to a specific task Devlin et al. (2019); Radford et al. (a). Variants of it include learning just a subset of the parameters Devlin et al. (2019); Collobert and Weston (2008), yet practitioners often retrain all of them to maximize the downstream performance. However, the enormity of GPT-3 175B makes it challenging to perform fine-tuning in the usual way due to the large checkpoint it produces and the high hardware barrier to entry since it has the same memory footprint as pre-training.\n' +

      'Parameter-Efficient Adaptation.Many have proposed inserting _adapter_ layers between existing layers in a neural network (Houlsby et al., 2019; Rebuffi et al., 2017; Lin et al., 2020). Our method uses a similar bottleneck structure to impose a low-rank constraint on the weight updates. The key functional difference is that our learned weights can be merged with the main weights during inference, thus not introducing any latency, which is not the case for the adapter layers (Section 3). A comtenporary extension of adapter is compacter(Mahabadi et al., 2021), which essentially parametrizes the adapter layers using Kronecker products with some predetermined weight sharing scheme. Similarly, combining LoRA with other tensor product-based methods could potentially improve its parameter efficiency, which we leave to future work. More recently, many proposed optimizing the input word embeddings in lieu of fine-tuning, akin to a continuous and differentiable generalization of prompt engineering (Li and Liang, 2021; Lester et al., 2021; Hambardzumyan et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2021). We include comparisons with Li and Liang (2021) in our experiment section. However, this line of works can only scale up by using more special tokens in the prompt, which take up available sequence length for task tokens when positional embeddings are learned.\n' +

      'Low-Rank Structures in Deep Learning.Low-rank structure is very common in machine learning. A lot of machine learning problems have certain intrinsic low-rank structure (Li et al., 2016; Cai et al., 2010; Li et al., 2018; Grasedyck et al., 2013). Moreover, it is known that for many deep learning tasks, especially those with a heavily over-parametrized neural network, the learned neural network will enjoy low-rank properties after training (Oymak et al., 2019). Some prior works even explicitly impose the low-rank constraint when training the original neural network (Sainath et al., 2013; Povey et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2014; Jaderberg et al., 2014; Zhao et al., 2016; Khodak et al., 2021; Denil et al., 2014); however, to the best of our knowledge, none of these works considers low-rank update to a frozen model for _adaptation to downstream tasks_. In theory literature, it is known that neural networks outperform other classical learning methods, including the corresponding (finite-width) neural tangent kernels (Allen-Zhu et al., 2019; Li and Liang, 2018) when the underlying concept class has certain low-rank structure (Ghorbani et al., 2020; Allen-Zhu and Li, 2019; Allen-Zhu and Li, 2020). Another theoretical result in Allen-Zhu and Li (2020) suggests that low-rank adaptations can be useful for adversarial training. In sum, we believe that our proposed low-rank adaptation update is well-motivated by the literature.\n' +

      'Given a limited parameter budget, which types of weights should we adapt with LoRA to obtain the best performance on downstream tasks?

      'We make an _important observation_ from Figure 3.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Directions corresponding to the top singular vector overlap significantly between \\(A_{r=8}\\) and \\(A_{r=64}\\), while others do not.

      '\n' +
      'Since both \\(A_{r=8}\\) and \\(A_{r=64}\\) are learned using the same pre-trained model, Figure 3 indicates that the top singular-vector directions of \\(A_{r=8}\\) and \\(A_{r=64}\\) are the most useful, while other directions potentially contain mostly random noises accumulated during training. Hence, the adaptation matrix can indeed have a very low rank.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Subspace similarity between different random seeds.We further confirm this by plotting the normalized subspace similarity between two randomly seeded runs with \\(r=64\\), shown in Figure 4. \\(\\Delta W_{q}\\) appears to have a higher "intrinsic rank" than \\(\\Delta W_{v}\\), since more common singular value directions are learned by both runs for \\(\\Delta W_{q}\\), which is in line with our empirical observation in Table 6. As a comparison, we also plot two random Gaussian matrices, which do not share any common singular value directions with each other.\n' +

      '\n' +
      'To answer these questions, we project \\(W\\) onto the \\(r\\)-dimensional subspace of \\(\\Delta W\\) by computing \\(U^{\\top}WV^{\\top}\\), with \\(U/V\\) being the left/right singular-vector matrix of \\(\\Delta W\\). Then, we compare the Frobenius norm between \\(\\|U^{\\top}WV^{\\top}\\|_{F}\\) and \\(\\|W\\|_{F}\\). As a comparison, we also compute \\(\\|U^{\\top}WV^{\\top}\\|_{F}\\) by replacing \\(U,V\\) with the top \\(r\\) singular vectors of \\(W\\) or a random matrix.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We draw _several conclusions_ from Table 7. First, \\(\\Delta W\\) has a stronger correlation with \\(W\\) compared to a random matrix, indicating that \\(\\Delta W\\) amplifies some features that are already in \\(W\\). Second, instead of repeating the top singular directions of \\(W\\), \\(\\Delta W\\) only _amplifies directions that are not emphasized in \\(W\\)_. Third, the amplification factor is rather huge: \\(21.5\\approx 6.91/0.32\\) for \\(r=4\\). See Section H.4 for why \\(r=64\\) has a smaller amplification factor. We also provide a visualization in Section H.3 for how the correlation changes as we include more top singular directions from \\(W_{q}\\). This suggests that the low-rank adaptation matrix potentially _amplifies the important features for specific downstream tasks that were learned but not emphasized in the general pre-training model_.\n' +

      '## 8 Conclusion and Future Work\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Fine-tuning enormous language models is prohibitively expensive in terms of the hardware required and the storage/switching cost for hosting independent instances for different tasks. We propose LoRA, an efficient adaptation strategy that neither introduces inference latency nor reduces input sequence length while retaining high model quality. Importantly, it allows for quick task-switching when deployed as a service by sharing the vast majority of the model parameters. While we focused on Transformer language models, the proposed principles are generally applicable to any neural networks with dense layers.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'There are many directions for future works. 1) LoRA can be combined with other efficient adaptation methods, potentially providing orthogonal improvement. 2) The mechanism behind fine-tuning or LoRA is far from clear - how are features learned during pre-training transformed to do well on downstream tasks? We believe that LoRA makes it more tractable to answer this than full fine\n' +

      'Few-shot learning, or prompt engineering, is very advantageous when we only have a handful of training samples. However, in practice, we can often afford to curate a few thousand or more training examples for performance-sensitive applications. As shown in Table 8, fine-tuning improves the model performance drastically compared to few-shot learning on datasets large and small. We take the GPT-3 few-shot result on RTE from the GPT-3 paper (Brown et al., 2020). For MNLI-matched, we use two demonstrations per class and six in-context examples in total.\n' +

      '## Appendix B Inference Latency Introduced by Adapter Layers\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Adapter layers are external modules added to a pre-trained model in a _sequential_ manner, whereas our proposal, LoRA, can be seen as external modules added in a parallel manner. Consequently, adapter layers must be computed in addition to the base model, inevitably introducing additional latency. While as pointed out in Ruckle et al. (2020), the latency introduced by adapter layers can be mitigated when the model batch size and/or sequence length is large enough to full utilize the hardware parallelism. We confirm their observation with a similar latency study on GPT-2 medium and point out that there are scenarios, notably online inference where the batch size is small, where the added latency can be significant.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We measure the latency of a single forward pass on an NVIDIA Quadro RTX8000 by averaging over 100 trials. We vary the input batch size, sequence length, and the adapter bottleneck dimension \\(r\\). We test two adapter designs: the original one by Houlsby et al. (2019), which we call AdapterH, and a recent, more efficient variant by Lin et al. (2020), which we call AdapterI. See Section 5.1 for more details on the designs. We plot the slow-down in percentage compared to the no-adapter baseline in Figure 5.\n' +

On MultiNLI, the combination of LoRA+PE doesn\'t perform better than LoRA, possibly because LoRA on its own already achieves performance comparable to the human baseline. Secondly, we notice that LoRA+PL performs slightly worse than LoRA even with more trainable parameters.

      'We present additional runs on GPT-3 with different adaptation methods in Table 15. The focus is on identifying the trade-off between performance and the number of trainable parameters.\n' +

      '### Low-Data Regime\n' +
      '\n' +
      'To evaluate the performance of different adaptation approaches in the low-data regime. we randomly sample 100, 1k and 10k training examples from the full training set of MNLI to form the low-data MNLI-\\(n\\) tasks. In Table 16, we show the performance of different adaptation approaches on MNLI-\\(n\\). To our surprise, PrefixEmbed and PrefixLayer performs very poorly on MNLI-100 dataset, with PrefixEmbed performing only slightly better than random chance (37.6% vs. 33.3%). PrefixLayer performs better than PrefixEmbed but is still significantly worse than Fine-Tune or LoRA on MNLI-100. The gap between prefix-based approaches and LoRA/Fine-tuning becomes smaller as we increase the number of training examples, which might suggest that prefix-based approaches are not suitable for low-data tasks in GPT-3. LoRA achieves better performance than fine-tuning on both MNLI-100 and MNLI-Full, and comparable results on MNLI-1k and MNLI-10K considering the (\\(\\pm 0.3\\)) variance due to random seeds.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The training hyperparameters of different adaptation approaches on MNLI-n are reported in Table 17. We use a smaller learning rate for PrefixLayer on the MNLI-100 set, as the training loss does not decrease with a larger learning rate.\n' +

      'In this paper we use the measure \\(\\phi(A,B,i,j)=\\psi(U_{A}^{i},U_{B}^{j})=\\frac{\\|U_{A}^{j}U_{B}\\|_{2}^{2}}{\\min \\{i,j\\}}\\) to measure the subspace similarity between two column orthonormal matrices \\(U_{A}^{i}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d\\times i}\\) and \\(U_{B}^{j}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d\\times j}\\), obtained by taking columns of the left singular matrices of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). We point out that this similarity is simply a reverse of the standard Projection Metric that measures distance between subspaces Ham & Lee (2008).\n' +

      '\n' +
      'One can naturally consider a _feature amplification factor_ as the _ratio_\\(\\frac{\\|\\Delta W\\|_{F}}{\\|U^{\\top}W^{\\top}\\|_{F}}\\), where \\(U\\) and \\(V\\) are the left- and right-singular matrices of the SVD decomposition of \\(\\Delta W\\). (Recall \\(UU^{\\top}WV^{\\top}V\\) gives the "projection" of \\(W\\) onto the subspace spanned by \\(\\Delta W\\).)\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Intuitively, when \\(\\Delta W\\) mostly contains task-specific directions, this quantity measures how much of them are amplified by \\(\\Delta W\\). As shown in Section 7.3, for \\(r=4\\), this amplification factor is as large as 20. In other words, there are (generally speaking) four feature directions in each layer (out of the entire feature space from the pre-trained model \\(W\\)), that need to be amplified by a very large factor 20, in order to achieve our reported accuracy for the downstream specific task. And, one should expect a very different set of feature directions to be amplified for each different downstream task.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'One may notice, however, for \\(r=64\\), this amplification factor is only around 2, meaning that _most_ directions learned in \\(\\Delta W\\) with \\(r=64\\) are _not_ being amplified by much. This should not be surprising, and in fact gives evidence (once again) that the intrinsic rank _needed_ to represent the "task-specific directions" (thus for model adaptation) is low. In contrast, those directions in the rank-4 version of \\(\\Delta W\\) (corresponding to \\(r=4\\)) are amplified by a much larger factor 20.\n' +
