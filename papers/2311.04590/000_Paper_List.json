        "abstract": "Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) methods aim to tackle the data sparsity and cold-start problems present in Single-Domain Sequential Recommendation (SDSR). Existing CDSR works design their elaborate structures relying on overlapping users to propagate the cross-domain information. However, current CDSR methods make closed-world assumptions, assuming fully overlapping users across multiple domains and that the data distribution remains unchanged from the training environment to the test environment. As a result, these methods typically result in lower performance on online real-world platforms due to the data distribution shifts. To address these challenges under open-world assumptions, we design an \\textbf{A}daptive \\textbf{M}ulti-\\textbf{I}nterest \\textbf{D}ebiasing framework for cross-domain sequential recommendation (\\textbf{AMID}), which consists of a multi-interest information module (\\textbf{MIM}) and a doubly robust estimator (\\textbf{DRE}). Our framework is adaptive for open-world environments and can improve the model of most off-the-shelf single-domain sequential backbone models for CDSR. Our MIM establishes interest groups that consider both overlapping and non-overlapping users, allowing us to effectively explore user intent and explicit interest. To alleviate biases across multiple domains, we developed the DRE for the CDSR methods. We also provide a theoretical analysis that demonstrates the superiority of our proposed estimator in terms of bias and tail bound, compared to the IPS estimator used in previous work.",
