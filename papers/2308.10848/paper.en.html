      '\n' +
      'Autonomous agents empowered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have undergone significant improvements, enabling them to generalize across a broad spectrum of tasks. However, in real-world scenarios, cooperation among individuals is often required to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of task accomplishment. Hence, inspired by human group dynamics, we propose a multi-agent framework AgentVerse that can effectively orchestrate a collaborative group of expert agents as a greater-than-the-sum-of-its-parts system. Our experiments demonstrate that AgentVerse can proficiently deploy multi-agent groups that outperform a single agent. Extensive experiments on text understanding, reasoning, coding, tool utilization, and embodied AI confirm the effectiveness of AgentVerse. Moreover, our analysis of agent interactions within AgentVerse reveals the emergence of specific collaborative behaviors, contributing to heightened group efficiency. Our code has been released at [https://github.com/OpenBMB/AgentVerse/](https://github.com/OpenBMB/AgentVerse/).\n' +
      '\n' +
      '## 1 Introduction\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The pursuit of creating intelligent and autonomous agents that can seamlessly assist humans and operate in real-world settings has been a foundational goal in artificial intelligence (Wooldridge and Jennings, 1995; Minsky, 1988; Bubeck et al., 2023). The recent advance of Large Language Models (LLMs) (OpenAI, 2023a; Anil et al., 2023; Touvron et al., 2023b) has created newfound avenues in this domain. These LLMs, especially GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023a), are particularly adept in comprehending human intent and executing commands. They have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in domains such as language understanding, vision (OpenAI, 2023b), and coding (Bubeck et al., 2023). By harnessing the power of LLMs, autonomous agents can make more nuanced decisions and perform actions with an unprecedented degree of autonomy (Zhou et al., 2023), Agents like AutoGPT (Richards and et al., 2023), BabyAGI (Nakajima, 2023), and AgentGPT (Reworkd, 2023), are inspiring examples. Furthermore, recent research has endowed autonomous agents with more human-analogous cognitive mechanisms, spanning from reflection (Yao et al., 2023b; Shinn et al., 2023), task decomposition (Wei et al., 2022b; Yao et al., 2023a), and tool utilization (Schick et al., 2023b; Qin et al., 2023a;b; Qian et al., 2023b). These advancements edge us closer to realizing the concept of artificial general intelligence (AGI) (Goertzel and Pennachin, 2007; Clune, 2019) that can generalize across a broader range of tasks.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'However, complex real-world tasks often require cooperation among individuals to achieve better effectiveness. Throughout history, numerous studies have delved into methods for enhancing collaboration among humans to improve work efficiency and effectiveness (Woolley et al., 2010; Fehr and Gachter, 2000). More recently, with the evolution of autonomous agents towards AGI, extensive research conceptualizes the assemblies of agents as a society or group (Li et al., 2023), and focuses on exploring the potential of their cooperation. For example, Park et al. (2023) found emergentsocial behaviors in multi-agent life simulation. Du et al. (2023); Wang et al. (2023b); Zhang et al. (2023a); Qian et al. (2023a); Chan et al. (2023) also underscored the enhanced decision-making of collaborating agents during collaborative problem-solving. However, a limitation in these studies is their narrow focus on specific and limited tasks, leaving the generalizability of their findings uncertain. An additional constraint is their static approach to agent collaboration, where agents\' roles and capabilities remain rigid, hindering adaptability.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'To address this problem, we introduce AgentVerse. This general multi-agent framework simulates the problem-solving procedures of human groups, and allows for dynamic adjustment of group members based on current progress. Specifically, AgentVerse splits the problem-solving process into four pivotal stages as shown in Figure 1: (1) _Expert Recruitment_: Determine and adjust the agent group\'s composition based on the ongoing problem-solving progression. (2) _Collaborative Decision-Making_: Engage the selected agents in joint discussions to devise problem-solving strategies. (3) _Action Execution_: Agents interact with their environment to implement the devised actions. (4) _Evaluation_ - Assess the differences between the current state and desired outcomes. If the current state is unsatisfactory, feedback is given to the next iteration for further refinement.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We conduct extensive experiments and case studies in diverse aspects including text understanding, reasoning, coding, tool utilization and embodied AI to show the effectiveness of AgentVerse. Additionally, we highlight the social behaviors that emerge from the multi-agent collaboration, and discuss their advantages and potential risks. In summary, our contributions are:\n' +
      '\n' +
      '* Inspired by the collaborative process of a human team, we propose AgentVerse as _an effective framework for promoting collaboration among multiple agents_ in problem-solving.\n' +
      '* We conduct extensive experiments to show that AgentVerse effectively improve the agents\' understanding, reasoning, coding, tool utilizing capabilities and their potential in embodied AI.\n' +
      '* In the multi-agent collaboration, especially within tool utilization and Minecraft game playing, agents manifest certain emergent behaviors. For example, (1) _volunteer behaviors_, characterized by agents offering assistance to peers, thus improving team efficiency; (2) _conformity behaviors_, where agents adjust their deviated behaviors to align with the common goal under the critics from others; (3) _destructive behaviors_, occasionally leading to undesired and detrimental outcomes.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '## 2 AgentVerse Framework\n' +
      '\n' +
      'A problem-solving process is a sequence of iterative stages within a human group (Bransford & Stein, 1993). Initially, the group assesses the difference between the current state and the desired goal, dynamically adjusting its composition to enhance collaboration in decision-making, and subsequently\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Figure 1: An illustration of the AgentVerse.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'executing well-informed actions. In order to enhance the effectiveness of an autonomous multi-agent group in achieving their goals, we simulate the problem-solving processes of a human group to propose the AgentVersE framework, which is composed of four crucial stages: **Expert Recruitment**, **Collaborative Decision-Making**, **Action Execution**, and **Evaluation**, as shown in Figure 1.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The entire process can be modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP), characterized as a tuple \\((\\mathcal{S},\\mathcal{A},\\mathcal{T},\\mathcal{R},\\mathcal{G})\\). This encompasses the autonomous agent and environment state space \\(\\mathcal{S}\\), solution and action space \\(\\mathcal{A}\\), transition function \\(\\mathcal{T}:\\mathcal{S}\\times\\mathcal{A}\\rightarrow\\mathcal{S}\\), reward function \\(\\mathcal{R}\\), and goal space \\(\\mathcal{G}\\).\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### Expert Recruitment\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Expert Recruitment stage determines the composition of a multi-agent group, playing an important role in deciding the upper bounds of the group\'s capabilities. Empirical evidence suggests that diversity within human groups introduces varied viewpoints, enhancing the group\'s performance across different tasks (Woolley et al., 2015; Phillips and O\'Reilly, 1998). Parallel findings from recent research suggest that designating specific roles for autonomous agents, similar to recruiting experts to form a group, can augment their efficacy (Li et al., 2023; Salewski et al., 2023; Qian et al., 2023a). Current methodologies for assigning role descriptions to autonomous agents predominantly involve manual assignment, necessitating prior knowledge and understanding of the task. Consequently, the scalability remains ambiguous, especially in the face of diverse and intricate problem contexts.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In view of this, AgentVersE automates expert recruitment to make agent configuration more scalable. For a given goal \\(g\\in\\mathcal{G}\\), a particular agent \\(M_{r}\\) is prompted as the "recruiter", similar to a human resource manager. Instead of relying on pre-defined expert descriptions, \\(M_{r}\\) dynamically generates a set of expert descriptions based on \\(g\\). The different agents prompted with these different expert descriptions then form an expert group \\(\\mathcal{M}=M_{r}(g)\\) on the given goal \\(g\\). Notably, the composition of a multi-agent group will be dynamically adjusted based on feedback from the evaluation stage (Section 2.4). This allows AgentVersE to employ the most suitable group based on the current state to make better decisions in future rounds.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### Collaborative Decision-making\n' +
      '\n' +
      'This stage engages expert agents in collaborative decision-making. To facilitate effective decision-making, previous research has investigated the impact of different communication structures among agents (Chan et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023b; Wu et al., 2023). We focus on two typical communication structures: _horizontal structure_ and _vertical structure_, respectively.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Horizontal Structure**[r,r] In this democratic structure, each agent, denoted as \\(m_{i}\\in\\mathcal{M}\\), shares and refines its decision \\(a_{m_{i}}\\). The group\'s collective decision, \\(A=f\\left(\\{a_{m_{i}}\\}_{i}\\right)\\in\\mathcal{A}\\), emerges as an integration of individual agents\' decisions using a function \\(f\\), which might involve techniques like summarization or ensemble. This structure is especially effective in scenarios like consulting and tool using.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Vertical Structure**[r,r] Conversely, vertical structure has a clear division of roles. An agent, termed the solver \\(m^{*}\\), proposes an initial decision \\(a_{0}^{*}\\). Other agents, as reviewers, provide feedback on this proposal, prompting iterative refinements by the solver until a consensus is reached among reviewers or a set number of iterations is exhausted. The final decision \\(A\\) is given as \\(A=a_{k}^{*}\\in\\mathcal{A}\\), with \\(k\\) indicating the number of refinements. Vertical structure is preferable for tasks like math problem-solving and software development, where only one refined decision is required.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### Action Execution\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In the decision-making stage, agents collaboratively contribute to a group decision \\(A\\) containing actions that need to be executed in the current environment. Within the action execution stage, agents then execute the collectively-decided actions in the environment. Depending on the implementation, some agents might not perform any execution. As a result of these actions, the state of the environment transitions from \\(s_{\\text{old}}\\) to \\(s_{\\text{new}}=\\mathcal{T}(s_{\\text{old}},A)\\).\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### Evaluation\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The evaluation stage is vital for AgentVerse, guiding improvements for subsequent rounds. At this stage, the feedback mechanism \\(\\mathcal{R}\\) assesses the difference between the current state \\(s_{\\text{new}}\\) and the desired goal \\(g\\in G\\). It then offers verbal feedback \\(r=\\mathcal{R}(s_{\\text{new}},g)\\), detailing areas of shortcoming and suggesting ways to enhance performance. \\(\\mathcal{R}\\) can either be defined by humans (in a human-in-the-loop (Amershi et al., 2014) setting) or an agent for automatic feedback, depending on the implementation.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'If the goal \\(g\\) remains unmet, the feedback \\(r\\) returns to the initial expert recruitment stage. In the next round, the expert recruitment stage will consider both feedback \\(r\\) and the goal \\(g\\) to adjust the group\'s composition, aiming to evolve a more effective multi-agent group according to the current progress.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '## 3 Experiments\n' +
      '\n' +
      'To validate the superiority of AgentVerse in facilitating agent collaboration over standalone agents, we design four experimental tasks. Each task is designed to assess distinct aspects of an agent group: general understanding and reasoning capabilities, coding capabilities, tool utilization capabilities, and their potential in Embodied AI. Our findings, which are detailed in this section, consistently highlight the superior performance of AgentVerse across these varied and multi-faceted tasks. Of particular interest is the emergence of unique collaborative behaviors within agent groups. While this section focuses on the advantages of multi-agent setups, a deeper exploration of these emergent behaviors will be presented in Section 4.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Setups.** In all the experiments, we evaluate the performance of agents driven by GPT-3.5-Turbo-0613 and GPT-4-0613 across various tasks. All the experiments are done in **zero-shot** setting. For all the quantitative experiments in this section, we compare three settings: (1) **CoT**: The CoT(chain-of-thought) agent; (2) **Solo**: Using AgentVerse with a single agent in the decision-making stage. Compared with CoT, Solo additionally incorporates the expert recruitment, action execution, and evaluation modules; (3) **Group**: Implementing AgentVerse with multiple agents collaborating during the decision-making. More detailed experimental setups for each task can be found in Appendix A.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### General Understanding and Reasoning Capabilities\n' +
      '\n' +
      'To assess the agents\' general understanding and reasoning capabilities, we use four datasets: FED (Mehri and Eskenazi, 2020), Commongen Challenge (Madaan et al., 2023), MGSM (Shi et al., 2023), and Logic Grid Puzzles (Srivastava et al., 2022). Detailed descriptions of these datasets and metrics can be found in Appendix A. The first two datasets are used to measure the agents\' text understanding and creative writing abilities, while the latter two focus on examining the agents\' reasoning abilities, including mathematical and logical reasoning.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Experimental Results.** The results in Table 1 show that agents assembled by AgentVerse (Solo and Group setups) consistently outperform the standalone CoT agent, irrespective of the LLM used. In our preliminary evaluations, GPT-3.5-Turbo struggles with accurately handling the logic grid puzzles dataset; therefore, we omit the result of GPT-3.5-Turbo on logical reasoning.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Interestingly, for GPT-3.5-Turbo, the Group setup underperforms the Solo setup in two of three tasks, indicating that the discussion in decision-making might adversely impact performance for agents based on GPT-3.5-Turbo in certain contexts. Delving deeper into this observation, one predominant factor surfaces: the susceptibility to erroneous feedback. A recurring pattern observed in the Group\n' +

      '\n' +
      'setup is that: sometimes Agent A, despite starting with a correct answer, would be easily swayed Agent B\'s incorrect feedback. Roughly 10% of errors in the MGSM dataset can be traced to this dynamic. Notably, this phenomenon is absent in GPT-4-based agents, highlighting the importance of agents\' resilience to conflicting information during collaborative discussions.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Overall, the results show that AgentVerse effectively enhances the general understanding and reasoning capabilities of agents. Moreover, agents driven by advanced LLMs demonstrate better performance when engaged in collaborative decision-making. The nuanced challenges observed with GPT-3.5-Turbo indicate the need to improve LLMs\' robustness on incorrect information so that the collaboration can amplify individual strengths without introducing new vulnerabilities.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Case Study: Consulting.In Table 1, the Group setup does not show a clear advantage over the Solo setup for both LLMs. This is mainly because the evaluation metrics for each benchmark have a limited scope. In the following case, we highlight the benefits of the group formed by GPT-4 agents by focusing on a consulting scenario where the group acts as a consultancy, responding to inquiries as shown in Figure 2. The goal is to offer suggestions for a hydrogen storage station in Ohio.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'At first glance, the Solo setup seems to cover a broader scope than the Group setup at round 0. However, the Group setup offers more depth thanks to the recruited experts. For instance, while the Solo setup might suggest something basic like "Find an optimal location", the Group setup provides detailed advice, such as "evaluating site soil properties to ensure storage tank stability." By the second round, different experts offer new insights in the Group setup. As a result, the Group setup not only covers a broader range (highlighted in red in the referenced figure) but also gives more detailed advice. For a detailed look at agent interactions, see Appendix F.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### Coding Capabilities\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In this section, we first assess the agents\' coding capabilities using the Humaneval code completion dataset. Next, through a case study, we illustrate how collaboration among multiple agents improves output quality, highlighting its superiority over software development by just one agent.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Experimental Results.In Table 2, we see a clear performance improvement moving from CoT to Solo and then to Group setup. This trend is especially pronounced with GPT-4, which sees a performance boost from 83.5 to 89.0. These results highlight AgentVerse\'s effectiveness in managing a skilled group of agents for coding. For GPT-3.5-Turbo, although we have observed a drop\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Figure 2: The illustration of an example process of consulting. The task is to _give some suggestions on building a compressed hydrogen storage station in Ohio_.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'in performance with Group setup in Section 3.1 due to incorrect agent feedback in math reasoning, the coding evaluations show benefits. We posit that this might be attributed to LLMs\' extensive pre-training on codes, potentially rendering them more adept at coding than mathematical reasoning and, consequently, more resilient to erroneous information in coding.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Case Study: Software Development.Our examination of the code generated for Humaneval by the Group setup in AgentVerse offers benefits beyond mere correctness. The agent group refines solutions, yielding more efficient, robust, and secure algorithms that are not covered by simple pass@1 metric. To better elucidate these advantages, we present a case study with GPT-4 on software development, a domain requiring multifaceted collaboration and refinement.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We present an example where AgentVerse creates a Python-based calculator GUI by bringing together diverse expert agents. A concise development process overview is visualized in Figure 3. Comparing the applications from the Group and Solo setups reveals notable distinctions. Both achieve core functionality, but the Group-created calculator boasts a user-friendly interface with features like color distinctions and keyboard input. This improved design resulted from the diverse feedback of the multi-agent group. Suggestions from UI designer and evaluators enhance the user experience, while software tester enhances code robustness. A deeper examination of the code confirms that the multi-agent group\'s output excels in exception handling compared to that of a solo agent. The codes generated by the two setups and the complete progress can be seen at Appendix F.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### Tool Utilization Capabilities\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The capability of LLMs to use real-world tools has been emphasized in many recent studies (Schick et al., 2023; Qin et al., 2023). By equipping the LLMs with different tools such as a calculator, a web browser, and a code interpreter, the capabilities of LLMs can be significantly improved. In this section, we demonstrate that AgentVerse enables a group of agents to address intricate and multi-faceted tasks that require interaction with multiple tools, thereby enhancing work efficiency.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Experimental Results.We design a set of 10 intricate tasks, each requiring the use of at least two distinct tools to accomplish. By providing agents access to several tools, including Bing search API, a web browser, a code interpreter, and task-related APIs, we explore how AgentVerse facilitates agent collaboration, dissects the overarching task into manageable sub-tasks, and effectively deploys the available tools to address realistic user queries. Of the **10** challenging tasks provided, an agent group orchestrated by AgentVerse adeptly accomplishes **9** tasks. On the other hand, a standalone ReAct agent (Yao et al., 2023), which is a prevalent agent designed for tool using, can only fulfill **3** tasks. In 6 out of 7 tasks where the single ReAct agent fails, the agent does not adhere to one or more criteria detailed in the task, and exit earlier than expected. We refer interested readers to Appendix B for a comprehensive comparison of the solutions given by AgentVerse and a single ReAct agent.\n' +

      'Case Study: Solving 24-Point Game and Providing Similar Games.Here, we present an example in Figure 4, illustrating how AgentVerse searches for the rules of 24-point game, implements the code along with test cases, and explores similar games. The task is multifaceted; thus, during decision-making stage, the agents split the task into two sub-tasks in their discussion, and each assigned to a certain agent. While agent Charlie overlooks the sub-task of identifying games similar to the 24-point game in round 0, feedback from the evaluation module rectifies this in the subsequent iteration. Ultimately, the agent group provides not only the 24-point game rules and a solving code with test cases, but also a summary of a similar game. In contrast, a standalone ReAct agent merely provides the game\'s definition along with a code and omits the query for similar games.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '## 4 Emergent Behaviors within a Multi-agent Group\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In the preceding section, the efficacy of AgentVerse has been illustrated across a spectrum of tasks that necessitate multi-agent decision-making, especially for GPT-4-based agents. Our endeavor, however, surpasses just improvements on benchmark datasets. We delve deeper into emergent collaborative behaviors exhibited by agents within realistic, embodied AI contexts. Minecraft, a sandbox game, serves as an ideal platform for such exploration due to its intricate parallelisms with real-world dynamics. In the game, agents must not just execute tasks but also plan, coordinate, and adjust to evolving situations. We task agents with collaboratively crafting a variety of items, spanning from paper and paintings to books and bookshelves. A succinct figure showcasing three agents adeptly crafting a bookshelf can be viewed in Figure 5. An elaborate visualization is placed at Appendix F, and details of the setups can be found in Appendix C.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'By examining the decision-making process, we identify several emergent behaviors and categorize them into three aspects: _volunteer_, _conformity_, and _destructive_ behaviors. Note that these behaviors not necessarily only appear in Minecraft but also in previous experiments such as tool utilization.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Figure 4: An example process of multi-agent solving user query with three different tools.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Figure 5: An illustration of the collaborative process involving three agents crafting a bookshelf. The process begins with the decision-making and breaking down the goal into several sub-tasks, with each agent receiving an assignment. The execution results and the current environmental state are then passed to the evaluator. This process repeats until the goal of crafting a bookshelf is achieved.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### Volunteer Behaviors\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Volunteer behaviors refer to actions intended to enhance the benefits of others in human society [11, 12]. We observe similar behaviors emerging in a multi-agent group as follows:\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Time Contribution.** The agents are willing to contribute their unallocated time to enhance collaboration efficiency. As shown in the examples in Figure 6 (1a), Alice and Bob need to collaboratively craft 2 paper, which necessitates three sugar canes as the raw material. Initially, Alice proposes that she will collect the sugar canes while Bob waits until the materials are ready. However, this plan is suboptimal, as it offers Bob spare time. Recognizing inefficiency, Bob suggests that both gather sugar canes concurrently, leading to expedited task completion.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Resource Contribution.** Our analysis reveals that the agents are willing to contribute the possessed materials. As illustrated in Figure 6 (1b), at the end of the task crafting 2 paper, Alice has collected all the raw materials (sugar canes), whereas Bob possesses the crafting table essential for the paper\'s creation. In the decision-making stage, Alice suggests transferring her materials to Bob by dropping them on the ground. This enables Bob to utilize them for the intended crafting process.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Assistance Contribution.** In the process of accomplishing tasks, we observe that agents, upon completing their individual assignments, actively extend support to their peers, thereby expediting the overall task resolution. As shown in Figure 6 (1c), Alice and Bob have successfully completed their assigned sub-tasks, while Charlie is still struggling to gather three leathers. During the collaborative decision-making phase, Alice and Bob propose to assist Charlie in gathering.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Figure 6: Examples of the properties emerge in the agent interactions in Minecraft.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'These behaviors highlight how agents willingly contribute their capabilities and efforts to assist other agents, culminating in an accelerated achievement of their mutual goal.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### Conformity Behavior\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In human society, individuals tend to adjust their behavior to align with the norms or goals of a group (Cialdini & Goldstein, 2004; Cialdini & Trost, 1998), which we refer to as _conformity behavior_. We also observe similar behaviors within multi-agent groups. As shown in Figure 6 (2), all agents are asked to gather three pieces of leather. However, Charlie gets sidetracked and begins crafting items that do not contribute directly to the task. In the subsequent decision-making stage, Alice and Bob critique Charlie\'s actions. Charlie acknowledges his mistake and re-focuses on the mutual tasks. The conformity behavior enables agents to align with mutual goals as work progresses.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### Destructive behavior\n' +

      'Additionally, we have also observed that agents may exhibit behaviors aimed at achieving greater efficiency, which could raise safety concerns. As depicted in Figure 6 (3a) and Figure 6 (3b), an agent occasionally bypasses the procedure of gathering raw materials and resorts to harming other agents or destroying an entire village library to acquire the necessary materials.\n' +

      'With advancements in autonomous agents, deploying them in real-world scenarios has become increasingly plausible. However, the emergence of hazardous behaviors could pose risks, especially when humans are involved in collaborative processes. Thus, designing strategies to prevent agents from adopting such hazardous behaviors is a critical area for future research.\n' +

      '**Autonomous Agents.** The pursuit of creating autonomous agents that can operate intelligently in real-world environments without human involvement has been a persistent goal throughout the history of AI (Wodbridge & Jennings, 1995; Minsky, 1988; Bubeck et al., 2023). Recently LLMs (Touvron et al., 2023a; OpenAI, 2023a) have opened up new opportunities to achieve this goal. These LLMs possess remarkable understanding, reasoning, and generation capabilities, allowing autonomous agents to utilize them as a backbone for handling increasingly complex scenarios (Richards & et al., 2023; Nakajima, 2023; Reworkd, 2023; Liu et al., 2023). However, even though these autonomous agents already demonstrate considerable power, they still lack certain essential human-analogous cognitive capabilities. Hence, some research designs external mechanisms that endow agents with reflection (Yao et al., 2023b; Shinn et al., 2023), task decomposition (Wei et al., 2022b; Yao et al., 2023a), and tool utilization/creation (Schick et al., 2023b; Qin et al., 2023a; Qian et al., 2023b) capabilities, which bring autonomous agents closer to achieving artificial general intelligence.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Multi-agent System.** In human society, a well-organized group composed of individual humans can often collaboratively handle a greater workload and accomplish complex tasks with higher efficiency and effectiveness. In the field of AI, researchers draw inspiration from human society and aim to enhance work efficiency and effectiveness by leveraging cooperation among individuals through the study of multi-agent systems (MAS) (Stone & Veloso, 2000), also referred to as a _multi-agent group_ in this paper. The multi-agent group collaboratively makes decisions and executes corresponding actions in a distributed and parallel manner to achieve the common goal, which significantly improves work efficiency and effectiveness. Previous works have leveraged multi-agent joint training to achieve this goal. Recently, some studies have attempted to leverage the intelligence and capabilities of agents for autonomous collaboration. Li et al. (2023) have conceptualized assemblies of agents as a group, and focused on exploring the potential of their cooperation. Park et al. (2023) found social behaviors autonomously emerge within a group of agents, and Du et al. (2023); Wang et al. (2023b); Zhang et al. (2023a); Qian et al. (2023a); Chan et al. (2023) further leverage multi-agent cooperation to achieve better performance on reasoning tasks. Based on these findings, we introduce a framework, denoted as AgentVerse, capable of leveraging group cooperation to manage more intricate scenarios. This framework can dynamically adjust its composition according to the current state, aiming to facilitate optimal decision-making and execution.\n' +

      '## 6 Conclusion\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In this study, we present AgentVerse, a novel and general multi-agent framework designed to emulate human group problem-solving processes. Our comprehensive experimental results highlight the efficacy of AgentVerse, demonstrating its enhanced performance in comparison to individual agents across a myriad of tasks. These tasks encompass general understanding, reasoning, coding, and tool utilization. Notably, AgentVerse consistently delivers remarkable results in addressing intricate user queries when fortified with the appropriate tools. In our investigations within the Minecraft environment, we identify both positive and negative emergent social behaviors among agents. As advancements in artificial general intelligence progress, understanding multi-agent interactions should become increasingly crucial. AgentVerse serves as a valuable step toward this endeavor, and we are optimistic about its potential adaptability and refinement for a wider array of tasks and contexts in the future.\n' +

      '## Appendix A Configurations of the Experiments\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Datasets and Evaluation MetricsOur evaluation assesses different aspects of agents, including general understanding and reasoning capabilities, coding capabilities and tool utilization capabilities.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '* **General Understanding Capabilities**: We utilize two datasets. The first one is a Dialogue response dataset, FED (Mehri and Eskenazi, 2020), where given a multi-round chat history, the agent or agent group is required to generate the next chat. Following previous work (Madaan et al., 2023), we utilize GPT-4 as the evaluator to score the agent-generated response against the human-written ones, and report the agent\'s win rate. The second dataset is Commongen-Challenge (Madaan et al., 2023), which is a constrained generation dataset where given 20 concepts, the agent is required to generate a coherent and grammatically correct paragraph containing as many concepts as possible. We report the average percentage of the covered concepts.\n' +
      '* **General Reasoning Capabilities**: We utilize the English subset of MGSM (Shi et al., 2023), which is a subset of GSM-8k (Cobbe et al., 2021), to evaluate the agents\' mathematical reasoning capabilities. It is a dataset containing grade school math problems. We report the percentage of the correct answers. And we use the logic grid puzzles task from BigBench (Srivastava et al., 2022), which contains logic problems that requires multi-step logic reasoning, to assess the agents\' logical reasoning capabilities. We report the accuracy.\n' +
      '* **Coding Capabilities**: We utilize Humaneval (Chen et al., 2021), which is a code completion dataset, and report Pass@1 metric1 Footnote 1: The method for calculating Pass@1 differs from the approach in Chen et al. (2021). Instead of generating multiple responses and calculating an unbiased estimator, we directly employ the first response to compute the Pass@1.\n' +
      '* **Tool Utilization Capabilities**: Since automatic evaluation on the performance of tool utilization is difficult, and there is currently no relevant benchmark, we craft 10 complex instructions and manually assess the performance. The instructions are listed in Appendix B.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Expert RecruitmentFor tasks including dialogue response, code completion, and constrained generation, four agents is recruited into the system. For the task of mathematical reasoning, we limited the number to two agents. This decision was based on our observation that an increase in the number of reviewers for mathematical reasoning tasks correlates with a higher likelihood of them giving erroneous critiques, leading to incorrect solutions by the solver. We have a discussion on this topic in Section 3.1. For tool utilization, we recruit two or three agents to engage in collaborative decision-making and action execution depending on the specific task. The detailed setups are listed at Appendix B. Currently the number of experts is pre-defined by us for each task. We are seeking a way to automate this decision as well.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Collaborative Decision-MakingFor tasks in coding and general understanding and reasoning, we use the vertical structure because all these tasks require only one response as the answer, and the solver in the vertical structure can be responsible for answering. For tool utilization, we use the horizontal structure because the agents should clarify their own sub-tasks in the discussion.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Action ExecutionFor the Humaneval code completion dataset benchmarked with GPT-4, we incorporate an additional agent during the action execution stage to craft unit testing code (in an zero-shot manner). Subsequently, the generated code is subjected to unit testing, and the testing results are conveyed as the environment state to the evaluation module.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Regarding the constrained generation dataset, Commongen-Challenge, the agent-generated response undergoes a concept coverage check. Any missing concepts are then passed to the evaluation module as the environment state.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In the context of tool utilization, each agent iteratively calls the tool in the ReAct manner, up to a maximum of 10 iterations. Upon reaching the final iteration, the agent is forced to draw a conclusion regarding the result, labeling the task\'s status as either "pending" or "finished". These conclusions are then forwarded to the evaluator for assessment.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'EvaluationTo facilitate a feedback loop, an agent was tasked with the role of evaluator. This agent, provided with the initial problem \\(p\\) and the decisions \\(A\\) made during the collaborative decision-making stage, is charged with determining the correctness of those decisions. In cases where the decision is identified as erroneous, feedback is channeled back to the expert recruitment stage. If the decision meets the accuracy criteria, it is determined as the final answer to \\(p\\). While our current configuration employs an agent for evaluation, we acknowledge the potential of human evaluators and intend to incorporate such experiments in future endeavors.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '## Appendix B Experiment Details for Multi-Agent Tool Using\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### Setups\n' +
      '\n' +
      'This section provides specific implementation details for enabling multiple agents in AgentVerse to collaboratively utilize tools to accomplish user\'s query. Unless specified herein, the implementation adheres to the standard procedures defined in the other experiments.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Collaborative Decision-MakingAgents recruited during the Expert Recruitment stage engage in collaborative discussions regarding the assigned task using a horizontal communication structure. In this configuration, agents communicate in a predetermined sequential order. At the conclusion of their discussions, an additional agent is designated as the "summarizer" and is responsible for consolidating the discussed sub-tasks for each participant.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Action ExecutionDuring action execution, we follow the ReAct prompting technique to let the agents write down their thought, and then call the tool, and we return the tool response to the agent. The agent again write down the thought and call the tools. The process iterates until the agent decide to submit its conclusion, or a maximum iteration number, which we set to be 10, is reached. In practice, we use OpenAI\'s function call to handle the tools.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### Results\n' +
      '\n' +
      'For action execution, the ReAct prompting technique is employed. Agents articulate their thought process, invoke the respective tool, and subsequently receive feedback from the tool. This cycle of reflection and tool interaction continues iteratively. The process concludes either when the agent finalizes its execution with its conclusion or after a pre-set maximum number of iterations--set (10 in our experiments). We utilize OpenAI\'s function call to handle the tool calls.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Instruction 1Recently, it has become popular in the AI field to verify the mathematical reasoning abilities of large language models by observing if they can solve the "24-Point Game." What is this game? Does it have a code-based solution? If it does, provide a Python code along with test cases and test its functionality. What are some other similar games that can be used to test the models\' mathematical reasoning abilities?\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Single ReAct Agent: (The generated code is omitted) The \'24-Point Game\' is a mathematical game where four numbers must be used with the basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) to make the number 24. The Python code I developed generates all possible combinations of the four numbers and operations to find a solution that equals 24.

      'In this section, we explain some implementation details of the experiments that we conduct on Minecraft (Section 4).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Expert RecruitmentAs noted in Section 4, real-world gaming scenarios requires intricate communication and coordination across multiple rounds, there is often a consistent set of team members. Therefore when using AgentVerse to simulate the game playing, we bypass the automated expert recruitment stage, and manually assign each agent as _"an experienced Minecraft player"_.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Collaborative Decision-MakingFor multi-player gameplay, the horizontal communication paradigm is favored. It lends itself to an environment where each agent independently formulates plans, diverging from traditional benchmark tasks which demand a singular solution. Agents are set to communicate in a predetermined sequential order, continuing until consensus is perceived. We let the agent to append a special token "[END]" at the end of its response if it finds that the group have reached consensus on the task assignment.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Subsequent to achieving consensus, an auxiliary agent is tasked to deduce the specific assignment for each agent from the entire communication record. This distilled information is then given as the input to the Voyager agent to inform it the assigned task.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Action ExecutionWe instantiate several Voyager agents within a shared Minecraft environment. A brief introduction of the Voyager agent is provided here, and we refer the interested readers to Wang et al. (2023a) for a more detailed exposition.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'A Voyager agent is adept at navigating Minecraft. On receiving a task, it first decomposes it into a set of manageable sub-tasks. For instance, if assigned the task "Kill 3 cows", the agent might decompose it into sequential sub-goals like: [punch 2 trees, Craft 4 wooden planks, Craft 1 stick, Craft 1 crafting table, Craft 1 wooden sword, Kill 3 cows]. The agent then sequentially attempt to complete each sub-task.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We employ the checkpoint available in the official repository2, and use GPT-4-0314 as the backbone LLM for Voyager agent to be consistent with Wang et al. (2023a).

      'In this work, we introduce AgentVerse that facilitates multiple autonomous agents to simulate human groups to accomplish tasks, and discuss the emergent social behaviors of agents during this process. AgentVerse is an advanced attempt; thus, there are some techniques within AgentVerse that still have room for improvement and are worthy of exploration. In this section, we delve into these aspects for further illustration.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**More Capable Agents and More Challenging Scenarios.** The AgentVerse is designed to enable various multiple LLM-based agents to collaboratively accomplish tasks. In the current research, we have utilized state-of-the-art agents based on GPT-4. With the advancements in LLMs, such as the newly released version of ChatGPT that incorporates voice and image capabilities (OpenAI, 2023b), LLM-based agents have more perceptual capabilities, including seeing, hearing, and speaking. These enhancements may increase the potential of agents and allow them to accomplish more complex real-world tasks based on the AgentVerse framework.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Multi-party Communication Among Agents.** The currently proposed autonomous agents (Richards and others, 2023; Nakajima, 2023; Reworkd, 2023; Wang et al., 2023a) LLMs possess excellent instruction comprehension capabilities (Wei et al., 2022a; Stiennon et al., 2020). This enables them to follow given human instructions and accomplish tasks within a one-on-one (human-to-AI) scenario. However, multi-agent collaboration involves a _multi-party communication_(Wei et al., 2023) scenario that requires the capability to autonomously determine _when to speak_ and _whom to speak_. This leads to difficulties in communication among the agents during the collaborative decision-making step within the AgentVerse framework. Hence, there are two directions worth exploring. Firstly, akin to the aforementioned, we can explore more effective mechanisms for managing agent communication. Additionally, we can design more advanced perceptual-aware LLMs (OpenAI, 2023b) that can autonomously interact with their environments3, including other agents.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Footnote 3: This kind of perceptual-aware agent has long been a goal of embodied AI (Ahn et al., 2022; Driess et al., 2023), which is a promising direction to explore.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Leverage Emergent Behaviors and Mitigate Safety Issues.** In Section 4, we identified both emergent positive and harmful behaviors. Exploring ways to leverage positive behaviors for improving work efficiency and effectiveness, as well as mitigating harmful behaviors, are promising directions.\n' +

      '* **Consulting in Vertical Structure** Similarly, Figures 17 and 18 showcase single-agent and multi-agent project consulting, but employing a vertical structure structure for multi-agent.\n' +
