      '\n' +
      'Reasoning, a crucial ability for complex problem-solving, plays a pivotal role in various real-world settings such as negotiation, medical diagnosis, and criminal investigation. It serves as a fundamental methodology in the field of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). With the ongoing development of foundation models, there is a growing interest in exploring their abilities in reasoning tasks. In this paper, we introduce seminal foundation models proposed or adaptable forreasoning, highlighting the latest advancements in various reasoning tasks, methods, and benchmarks. We then delve into the potential future directions behind the emergence of reasoning abilities within foundation models. We also discuss the relevance of multimodal learning, autonomous agents, and super alignment in the context of reasoning. By discussing these future research directions, we hope to inspire researchers in their exploration of this field, stimulate further advancements in reasoning with foundation models, e.g. Large Language Models (LLMs), and contribute to the development of AGI. *\n' +

      '_"Humans have always done nonmonotonic reasoning, but rigorous monotonic reasoning in reaching given conclusions has been deservedly more respected and admired."_\n' +
      '\n' +
      'John McCarthy (2004)\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Reasoning is an essential aspect of artificial intelligence, with applications spanning various fields, such as problem-solving, theorem proving, decision-making, and robotics (Manning, 2022). _Thinking, Fast and Slow_(Daniel, 2017) elucidates a dual-system framework for the human mind, consisting of "System 1" and "System 2" modes of thought. "System 1" operates rapidly, relying on instincts, emotions, intuition, and unconscious processes. In contrast, "System 2" operates slower, involving conscious deliberation such as algorithmic reasoning, logical analysis, and mathematical abilities. Reasoning plays a crucial role as one of the key functions of "System 2" (Bengio, 2017; Weston and Sukhbaatar, 2023). Reasoning can be categorized into two broad types: formal language reasoning and natural language reasoning (Reiter, 1975; Berzonsky, 1978; Teig and Scherer, 2016; Yu et al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023). On one hand, as shown in Figure 1, formal language reasoning is often used in areas like formal verification of software and hardware systems, theorem proving and automated reasoning (Reiter, 1975; Berzonsky, 1978). On the other hand, natural language reasoning enables more intuitive human-computer interactions and supports tasks like question answering (Shao et al., 2023; Jiang et al., 2021), information retrieval (Zhu et al., 2023; Ai et al., 2023), text summarization (Liu et al., 2023), and sentiment analysis (Yu et al., 2023; Araci, 2019; Barbieri et al., 2021).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Since their inception, foundation models (Bommasani et al., 2021) have demonstrated remarkable efficacy across various domains, including natural language processing (Qiao et al., 2022), computer vision (Wang et al., 2023), and multimodal tasks (Li, 2023). However, the burgeoning interest in general-purpose artificial intelligence has sparked a compelling debate regarding whether foundation models can exhibit human-like reasoning abilities. Consequently, there has been a surge of interest in studying the reasoning capabilities of foundation models. While previous surveys have explored the application potential of foundation models from different perspectives (Gu et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023; Yin et al., 2023; Zong et al., 2023; Lou et al., 2023; Charalambous et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023, 2023), there remains a need for a systematic and comprehensive survey that specifically focuses on recent advancements in multimodal and interactive reasoning, which emulates human reasoning styles more closely. Figure 2 presents an overview of reasoning with regard to tasks and techniques that this article will discuss.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Foundation models typically consist of billions of parameters and undergo (pre-)training using self-supervised learning (Jain et al., 2023) on a broad dataset (Bommasani et al., 2021). Once (pre-)trained, foundation models can be adapted to solve numerous downstream tasks through task-specific fine-tuning, linear probing, or prompt engineering, demonstrating remarkable generalizability and impressive accuracy (Bommasani et al., 2021; Qiu et al., 2023). In contrast to the softattention mechanisms utilized in conventional transformers, System 2 Attention (S2A) harnesses the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to facilitate linguistic reasoning. This method improves the factuality and objectivity of long-form content generation. By integrating logical rules and principles into the learning process (Mao et al., 2023), these models can perform complex tasks such as deduction and inference. This allows them to make decisions based on explicit knowledge (Mao et al., 2023) and logical reasoning, rather than relying solely on statistical patterns (Yang et al., 2023). As a rapidly growing field in artificial intelligence research, reasoning with foundation models aims to develop models capable of understanding and interacting with complex information in a more human-like manner. Built upon a foundation of logical reasoning and knowledge representation, these models make it possible to reason about abstract concepts and make decisions based on logical rules.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'First, reasoning with foundation models enables the application of prior knowledge and domain expertise. Logical rules can be derived from expert knowledge or formalized from existing ontologies or knowledge graphs. By leveraging this prior knowledge, models can benefit from a better understanding of the problem domain and make more informed decisions. Second, reasoning with foundation models can enhance the robustness and generalization capabilities. By incorporating the information contained in massive amounts of data, models can better handle situations facing limited data or encountering unseen scenarios during deployment. This enables models to be more reliable and study for robust, real-world usage.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In contrast to current surveys that have primarily focused on specific aspects of foundation models, such as prompts (Qiao et al., 2022), hallucination (Rawte et al., 2023), deductive reasoning (Huang and Chang, 2022), logical reasoning (Friedman, 2023; Yang et al., 2023), causal reasoning (Kiciman et al., 2023; Stolfo et al., 2022), health informatics (Qiu et al., 2023), or AI agents (Xi et al., 2023), this paper takes a broader perspective, aiming to connect various research efforts in this area in a cohesive and organized manner. As Figure 2 shows, we provide a concise overview of various reasoning tasks, including **Commonsense Reasoning, Mathematical Reasoning, Logical Reasoning, Causal Reasoning, Visual Reasoning, Audio\n' +

By doing so, we provide a comprehensive overview highlighting the interconnections and relationships between different aspects of the field to inspire more research efforts to actively engage with and further the advances of reasoning with foundation models.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In summary, we have conducted a survey of over 650 papers on foundation models, primarily focusing on research from the past two years. We discuss different tasks, approaches, techniques, and benchmarks used in these models. We also explore various application domains that can benefit from reasoning with foundation models, such as question-answering, automated reasoning, and knowledge representation. We also discuss the challenges and limitations of current reasoning with foundation models and potential directions for future research. By understanding the advancements and challenges in this field, researchers can explore new avenues for developing intelligent systems that can reason and make decisions in a more human-like and interpretable manner. Overall, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of reasoning with foundation models, its current state, and future possibilities.\n' +

      '### Definition of Reasoning\n' +
      '\n' +
      'When the term "reasoning" is brought up, its precise meaning is often unclear to people. To clarify, let us first establish a clear definition of reasoning. "Reasoning" is a broad and multifaceted concept that manifests in various contexts. It encompasses cognitive processes and logical thinking employed to analyze information, make deductions, draw conclusions, and formulate coherent arguments. Reasoning can be observed in diverse domains, such as scientific inquiry, problem-solving, decision-making, and everyday discourse. Its fundamental purpose is to enable individuals to connect pieces of information, evaluate relationships, and arrive at informed judgments or solutions. By exploring the different facets and dimensions of reasoning, we can gain a comprehensive understanding of its significance and explore the mathematical formalisms and techniques employed to elucidate and enhance this fundamental aspect of human cognition.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In addition to its broad conceptual nature, the term "reasoning" carries specific definitions within various fields. Let us briefly touch upon the definitions of reasoning\n' +

      '\n' +
      'PhilosophyDefinition 1: (Cognitive reasoning). Cognitive reasoning refers to modeling the human ability to draw meaningful conclusions despite incomplete and inconsistent knowledge involving among others the representation of knowledge where all processes from the acquisition and update of knowledge to the derivation of conclusions must be implementable and executable on appropriate hardware (Furbach et al., 2019).\n' +

      'NlpDefinition 3: (Natural language reasoning). Natural language reasoning is a process of integrating multiple knowledge (e.g., encyclopedic knowledge and commonsense knowledge) to derive some new conclusions about the (realistic or hypothetical) world.

In this example, the black text represents the given knowledge, while the red text represents the inferred knowledge. The term “Fact” indicates specific information, while “Rule” denotes a general principle or guideline.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '#### 2.1.1 Deductive, Abductive, and Inductive Reasoning\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Before delving into recent developments, let us first review the traditional perspectives on reasoning, which categorizes it into three primary types: inductive reasoning, deductive reasoning, and abductive reasoning. This categorization has long been recognized and provides a framework for understanding the different modes of reasoning. By examining each type, we can better understand their distinctive characteristics and applications. So, let us take a closer look at these traditional categories to enhance our comprehension of reasoning processes.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Table 3 provides an example to explain these three reasoning types, respectively. Deductive reasoning is a logical process that derives specific conclusions from general principles or premises. It follows a top-down approach, starting with general principles and applying logical rules to reach specific conclusions. Deductive reasoning aims to provide logically valid and conclusive results.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Inductive reasoning involves drawing general conclusions or patterns based on specific observations or evidence. It moves from specific instances to broader generalizations. Inductive reasoning does not guarantee absolute certainty but provides probable conclusions based on available evidence (Wang et al., 2023).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Abductive reasoning is the process of making plausible explanations or hypotheses to account for observed facts or data. It involves inferring the best possible explanation from incomplete or limited information. Abductive reasoning is often used in problem-solving and hypothesis generation.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In commonly used terms of reasoning, for a non-fallacious argument (an argument consisting of a premise and a conclusion) (Flach and Kakas, 2000), a deductive argument is classified as such when the premise can offer conclusive support for the conclusion. In other words, if all the premises of the argument are true, it would be impossible for the conclusion to be false. On the other hand, an inductive argument is characterized by the premise providing only partial support for the conclusion (Salmon et al., 1989). In the case of inductive arguments, the conclusions extend or surpass the information contained in the premises (Salmon et al., 1989). Unlike deductive arguments that provide conclusive proof or inductive arguments that offer partial support, abductive arguments aim to provide the most reasonable explanation for a given situation, even if it may not be the only possible explanation.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Typically, in the trio of reasoning types, which includes deduction, abduction, and induction, the most extensively studied and explored is deduction, while research on abduction and induction has remained relatively limited and under-explored (Flach and Kakas, 2000; Yang et al., 2023). Encouragingly, progress has been made recently in the field of inductive reasoning. Sinha et al. (2019) propose the CLUTRR dataset for classifying kinship relations in short stories using Natural Language Understanding (NLU). Inductive Relation Induction (Yang et al., 2022) investigates the prediction of relation that involves unseen entities. Misra et al. (2022) focus on classifying synthetic language sentences using neural networks, whereas Yang and Deng (2021) have studied rule induction using quasi-natural language (symbolic rather than natural language).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Other taxonomies of reasoning tasks include:\n' +
      '\n' +
      '1. **Formal Reasoning vs. Informal Reasoning**(Evans and Thompson, 2004; Teig and Scherer, 2016): This taxonomy is based on the nature or formality of thereasoning process. Formal reasoning involves following strict rules, logical frameworks, or formal systems to derive conclusions and often relies on mathematical or deductive reasoning. Informal reasoning, on the other hand, is less structured and more intuitive, relying on personal experiences, common sense, and heuristics.\n' +
      '2. **Neural Reasoning vs. Symbolic Reasoning vs. Neural-Symbolic Reasoning**(Garcez et al., 2008, 2015, 2022): This taxonomy is based on the underlying computational framework used for reasoning. Neural reasoning refers to approaches that utilize neural networks or deep learning models for reasoning tasks. Symbolic reasoning involves using symbolic representations, logic-based inference rules, or symbolic manipulation for reasoning. Neural-symbolic reasoning combines elements of both neural networks and symbolic reasoning, aiming to integrate their respective strengths.\n' +
      '3. **Backward Reasoning vs. Forward Reasoning**(Al-Ajlan, 2015): This taxonomy is based on the direction of the reasoning process. Backward reasoning starts from a goal or desired outcome and works backward by applying rules or evidence to determine the necessary conditions or steps to reach that goal. Forward reasoning starts with initial premises or evidence and progresses step-by-step to derive new conclusions or reach a final outcome.\n' +
      '4. **Single-step Reasoning vs. Multi-step Reasoning**(Song et al., 2018; Yu et al., 2023a): This taxonomy is based on the complexity or number of steps involved in the reasoning process. Multi-step reasoning refers to tasks that require multiple sequential or interconnected steps to arrive at a solution or conclusion. It involves chaining together intermediate steps or inferences to reach the final result.\n' +
      '5. **Deductive Reasoning vs. Defeasible Reasoning**(Yu et al., 2023a; Koons, 2005; Pollock, 1987, 1991): The classification criterion for this type of reasoning is based on the nature of the reasoning process and the handling of exceptions or conflicting information. Defeasible reasoning involves reasoning under uncertainty or with incomplete information, where conclusions can be overridden or defeated by new evidence or exceptions. It allows for the revision or re-evaluation of conclusions based on additional information or context.\n' +
      '6. **Unimodal Reasoning vs. Multimodal Reasoning**(Sowa, 2003; Oberlander et al., 1996): This taxonomy is based on the input modalities used in the reasoning process. Unimodal reasoning refers to reasoning tasks that involve a single modality of information or input, for example, reasoning tasks that are based solely on language information. Multimodal reasoning, on the other hand, involves integrating and reasoning with multiple modalities of information simultaneously. This could include combining visual, language, textual, auditory, or other types of input for the reasoning process.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In addition to the categorization mentioned above, there are several other ways to classify or categorize information and reasoning, including factual reasoning (Byrne and Tasso, 1999), counterfactual reasoning (Bottou et al., 2013), plausible (defeasible) reasoning (Collins and Michalski, 1989), default reasoning (Brewka, 2012), and abstract reasoning (Yu et al., 2021).\n' +

Swin Transformer (Liu et al., 2021) introduces a hierarchical structure with shifted windows, improving the efficiency of processing high-resolution images. It has demonstrated strong performance across various computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. Methods like MAE (He et al., 2022), BEIT (Bao et al., 2021), and CAE (Chen et al., 2023) propose masked modeling as an efficient self-supervised learning strategy to learn general-purpose visual representations.

CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) learns joint representations of images and text. It achieves this by aligning visual and textual information, enabling cross-modal understanding, and demonstrating impressive capabilities in various vision and language tasks.

In CLIP Surgery (Li et al., 2023t), heatmaps are first generated based on text prompts. Point prompts, which are then sampled from these heatmaps, are then inputted into SAM (Kirillov et al., 2023) for further processing. Following this, a similarity algorithm utilizing CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) is employed to produce the final segmentation map. SAMText (He et al., 2023) presents a flexible approach for creating segmentation masks tailored to scene text. This method initiates by deriving bounding box coordinates from the annotations present in an existing scene text detection model. These coordinates then prompt SAM to generate masks. Caption Anything (Wang et al., 2023o) presents a foundational model-enhanced framework for image captioning that enables interactive multimodal control from both visual and linguistic aspects. By combining SAM (Kirillov et al., 2023) with ChatGPT, users gain the flexibility to manipulate images using a variety of prompts, including points prompts or bounding boxes prompts, during interaction. It additionally leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to refine instructions, ensuring they accurately reflect the user\'s intended meaning and remain consistent with their intention.

      'Math Word Problems (MWPs) are commonly used to evaluate the arithmetic reasoning abilities of language models. While these issues may appear uncomplicated to humans, language models frequently encounter challenges when it comes to tasks involving arithmetic reasoning (Hendrycks et al., 2021b; Patel et al., 2021).\n' +

      'Previous research has explored various approaches to address these challenges. Template-based statistical learning methods like KAZB (Kushman et al., 2014), ZDC (Zhou et al., 2015), and similarity-based method SIM (Huang et al., 2016) have been utilized. Wang et al. (2017) employs a recurrent neural network (RNN) to convert math word problems into equation templates, eliminating the need for complex feature engineering. Additionally, they developed a hybrid model that integrates the RNN with a similarity-based retrieval system, further enhancing its performance. Xie and Sun (2019) introduces an innovative neural approach to construct expression trees in a goal-oriented manner for solving math word problems. Shen et al. (2021a) introduces a novel ranking task for math word problems and presents the Generate & Rank framework, which combines a generative pre-trained language model with multi-task learning. This approach allows the model to learn from its errors and effectively differentiate between correct and incorrect expressions. A notable finding is that employing chain-of-thought prompting, along with a language model containing an impressive 540 billion parameters, yields performance comparable to task-specific fine-tuned models across multiple tasks (Wei et al., 2022b). Unlike traditional symbolic reasoning tasks such as program synthesis and knowledge graph reasoning, solving MWPs requires additional emphasis on numerical reasoning. PromptPG (Lu et al., 2022b) takes a different approach by utilizing policy gradient techniques to learn the selection ofin-context examples. By dynamically constructing appropriate prompts for each test example, PromptPG facilitates the solving of math word problems. This adaptive approach enhances the model\'s ability to handle numerical reasoning tasks effectively.

(2021) introduce Neural Geometric Solver (NGS) as an approach to addressing challenges posed by geometric problems in the GeoQA benchmark (Chen et al., 2021). NGS adopts a holistic approach, adeptly parsing multimodal information and generating interpretable programs. Geoformer (Chen et al., 2022) concurrently addresses calculation and proving problems through sequence generation. This approach demonstrates improved reasoning capabilities in both tasks by employing a unified formulation. Additionally, the authors propose the Mathematical Expression Pretraining (MEP) method, predicting mathematical expressions within problem solutions (Chen et al., 2022). This technique enhances the model\'s ability to handle mathematical expressions effectively. Inter-GPS (Lu et al., 2021) formulates the geometry-solving task as a problem-goal-searching process. By incorporating theorem knowledge as conditional rules, Inter-GPS enables step-by-step symbolic reasoning, facilitating effective geometry problem-solving.\n' +

      '\n' +
      'Theorem proving is pivotal in both hardware and software verification (Khan et al., 2020; Li et al., 2005). In the context of hardware verification, it has found successful application in the design of integrated circuits (Khan et al., 2020; Li et al., 2005). In the realm of software verification, a notable achievement is the development of CertC, a verified C compiler (Berghofer and Strecker, 2004). It is worth mentioning that companies such as Intel have made significant investments in formal methods to ensure the absence of critical floating-point bugs in their processors. A prominent example of the consequences of such bugs is the costly Pentium FDIV bug in 1994, which resulted in a loss of $500 million (Harrison, 2010). Consequently, theorem proving has played a pivotal role in verifying floating-point firmware (Harrison, 2010). Traditionally, theorem proving has relied on highly trained human experts proficient in specific theorem proving tools and their respective application domains. However, the emergence of learnable automated theorem proving holds the potential to revolutionize hardware and software verification in two significant ways. First, it enhances the level of automation in theorem proving, making it less reliant on human expertise and manpower. Second, it increases the adaptability of these methods, broadening their utility and applicability through machine learning.\n' +

Inrecent years, various approaches have integrated machine learning with ITPs (Yang and Deng, 2019; Gauthier et al., 2021). Validated on various datasets (PISA (Jiang et al., 2021), miniF2F (Zheng et al., 2021), LeanDojo (Yang et al., 2023), FIMO Liu et al. (2023) and TRIGO (Xiong et al., 2023)), these approaches leverage advancements in language models (Polu and Sutskever, 2020; Han et al., 2021; Polu et al., 2023; jia, 2022; Lample et al., 2022; Mikula et al., 2023) to recommend actions based on the current state of the proof, with a tree search identifying a sequence of correct steps using actions provided by the language model. Methods like Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) (Silver et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2021; Laurent and Platzer, 2022) or dynamic-tree MCTS (Wang et al., 2023) are employed for this purpose. Previous work has demonstrated the few-shot statement autoformalization capability of large language models (LLMs) (Wu et al., 2022). To investigate the applicability of these findings to proof autoformalization, DSP conducted a thorough analysis using Draft, Sketch, and Proof (Jiang et al., 2022). Subgoal-Learning (Zhao et al., 2023) utilizes the subgoal-goal informal proof and demonstration selection. LeanDojo (Yang et al., 2023) is an open-source project for Lean (Moura and Ullrich, 2021), which contains toolkits, data, models, and benchmarks. Lyra (Zheng et al., 2023) proposes the use of Tool Correction to mitigate LLM hallucinations and Conjecture Correction to improve the quality of generated formal proof conjectures. Following the direction of Lyra, the LEGO-Prover (Xin et al., 2023) employs a growing skill library containing verified lemmas as skills to enhance the capability of LLMs used in theorem proving.\n' +

      'Scientific reasoning encompasses the cognitive abilities and problem-solving skills required for formulating, evaluating, and refining hypotheses or theories. In the case of highly developed proficiency, it also involves critical reflection on the process of acquiring and evolving knowledge through these investigative activities (Morris et al., 2012). As mathematical reasoning forms the foundation of, we mention scientific reasoning here.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Scientific reasoning is closely relevant to AI for Science (AI4Science) (Zhang et al., 2023). This relevance extends across a spectrum of fields, including physics, chemistry, quantum mechanics, and more. The integration of foundation models into these domains not only enhances our understanding but also opens up new avenues for exploration and innovation. The potential for foundation models to revolutionize traditional scientific methods, accelerate discoveries, and solve complex problems is immense, making them an indispensable tool in the modern scientific landscape. Subramanian et al. (2023) examine how various factors affect the transfer learning capabilities of foundational models, such as the size of pre-trained models, dataset scale, a blend of models, and parameters outside the training distribution. Their study finds that increasing the number of model parameters can enhance performance. Furthermore, the "pre-train and fine-tune" approach is highly effective for scientific reasoning tasks, particularly in physical systems governed by Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). Horawalavithana et al. (2022) modify OpenAI\'s GPT-2 transformer decoder architecture to develop a 1.47 billion parameter general-purpose model specifically for chemistry. This large-scale model demonstrates proficiency not only in in-domaintasks but also in out-of-domain challenges. It is trained on a substantial corpus of 670GB of text data, encompassing approximately 53.45 million chemistry-focused scientific articles and abstracts. IBM RXN for Chemistry (Team, 2022; Manica et al., 2023; Das et al., 2021) utilizes foundational models for predicting chemical reactions and procedural methodologies in chemistry. For a more comprehensive exploration of foundational models related to biology, please see Section 3.9.3 and Section 3.9.4. We will not elaborate further on biology foundation models here. Currently, most scientific reasoning research predominantly concentrates on fields like mathematics, physics, biology, and medicine (Qiu et al., 2023). In contrast, foundational models in the quantum realm are comparatively scarce. Building scalable foundation models for quantum systems faces several challenges, including the intrinsic complexity of quantum mechanics, limited data availability, the absence of standardized methodologies, and constraints in quantum hardware capabilities. Despite these hurdles, venturing into this promising field presents an intriguing and potentially rewarding area of exploration.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Standardization aids in advancing the field of scientific reasoning. Proposing datasets or benchmarks is a process of standardization. Currently, datasets for scientific reasoning are mainly focused on fields such as mathematics, physics, and chemistry, examples of which include SciBench (Wang et al., 2023), ScienceWorld (Wang et al., 2022), and ScienceQA (Lu et al., 2022). SciBench (Wang et al., 2023) is a specialized benchmark designed to evaluate the scientific reasoning capabilities, domain knowledge, and advanced calculation skills of LLMs in the context of college-level scientific problems. This comprehensive benchmark encompasses a meticulously curated collection of 695 problems carefully sourced from instructional textbooks. SciBench consists of two datasets. The first dataset constitutes an expansive collection of collegiate-level scientific problems sourced from mathematics, chemistry, and physics textbooks. Its primary objective is to evaluate the LLM\'s capacity to handle a diverse array of scientific topics and problem categories. The second dataset in SciBench, on the other hand, consists of problems sourced from computer science and mathematics undergraduate exams, forming a closed set. This closed set is intentionally crafted to gauge the LLMs\' proficiency in solving precise problem-solving challenges within these particular fields. ScienceWorld (Wang et al., 2022) is designed to evaluate agents\' scientific reasoning capabilities within an interactive text environment. This environment simulates a standard elementary school science curriculum, featuring 30 high-level task types distributed across 10 different topics. The environment supports multiple states, allowing for diverse interactions and scenarios. By abstracting the world and incorporating a wide range of objects, ScienceWorld provides a complex interactive text environment for agents to navigate and reason therein. It consists of 10 interconnected locations, each containing up to 200 types of objects. These objects span a range of categories, and common environmental items like furniture, books, and paintings. The environment provides a rich and diverse setting for agents to interact with. The action set within ScienceWorld consists of 25 high-level actions, covering actions related to the domain of science and common actions. Each step in ScienceWorld presents approximately 200,000 possible action-object pairs, although only a proportion of these pairs will have actual implicationsfor the task at hand. ScienceQA (Lu et al., 2022a) is a multimodal dataset comprising 21,208 multiple-choice science questions sourced from elementary and high school science curricula. The dataset offers a richer domain diversity by covering natural science, language science, and social science topics.\n' +

      '### Logical Reasoning\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Logical reasoning, covering propositional and predicate logic (Table 4), is a rigorous form of thinking that involves using premises and their relations to derive conclusions that are implied by the premises (Nunes, 2012). It can serve as a fundamental basis for various domains in computer science and mathematics.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Previous studies have explored the combination of neural networks and symbolic reasoning in neuro-symbolic methods (Mao et al., 2019; Pryor et al., 2023; Tian et al., 2022; Cai et al., 2021; Sun et al., 2021; Manhaeve et al., 2021; Gupta et al., 2019). However, these methods often face limitations such as specialized module designs that lack generalizability or brittleness caused by optimization difficulties. In contrast, LLMs exhibit stronger generalization abilities when it comes to logical reasoning. The Logic-LM framework (Pan et al., 2023a) leverages LLMs and symbolic reasoning to enhance logical problem-solving (Luo et al., 2023d). It begins by utilizing LLMs to convert natural language problems into symbolic formulations, which are then processed by deterministic symbolic solvers for inference. Additionally, a self-refinement stage is introduced, where error messages from the symbolic solver are utilized to revise the symbolic formalizations. Bubeck et al. (2023) demonstrate that the GPT-4 model can manifest logical reasoning abilities when addressing mathematical and general reasoning problems. These higher-order capabilities, often referred to as emergent properties, result from scaling the model with large datasets (Wei et al., 2022a). Zhao et al. (2023a) employ language models for multi-step logical reasoning by integrating explicit planning into their inference procedure. This incorporation enables more informed reasoning decisions at each step by considering their future effects. Furthermore, Creswell et al. (2023) propose the Selection-Inference (SI) framework, which employs pre-trained LLMs as general processing modules. The SI framework alternates between selection and inference steps to generate a sequence of interpretable, causal reasoning steps that lead to the final answer.\n' +

      'Recent works leveraging LLMs for logical reasoning tasks can be categorized into two main approaches, as shown in Figure 7. The first approach is in-context learning, where specific prompts are used to elicit step-by-step reasoning from LLMs. Notable methods in this category include chain-of-thought prompting (Wei et al., 2022b; Wang et al., 2023) and the least-to-most prompting approach (Zhou et al., 2022a). Theseapproaches enable reasoning directly over natural language, providing flexibility. However, the complexity and ambiguity of natural language can result in challenges such as unfaithful reasoning and hallucinations. The second approach is fine-tuning, where the reasoning capabilities of LLMs are optimized through fine-tuning or training specialized modules (Clark et al., 2020; Tafjord et al., 2022; Yang et al., 2022b).\n' +

      'Causal reasoning refers to the process of understanding and explaining cause-and-effect relationships between events, actions, or variables (Waldmann and Hagmayer, 2013; Liu et al., 2023l). Causal reasoning tasks can be categorized into causal discovery, effect inference, attribution, judgment, and other tasks (Kiciman et al., 2023). Causal discovery is the process of uncovering the directional cause-and-effect relationships between variables. Effect inference involves the characterization of the magnitude and pattern of a known or postulated causal connection (LYU et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2021; Jin et al., 2023b). Attribution, on the other hand, entails identifying the cause or causes behind a specific change. Judgment tasks expand on attribution tasks by encompassing the assignment of reward or blame for outcomes. Additionally, these tasks encompass various domains such as policy optimization, decision-making, explanation, scientific discovery, and more.\n' +

      'A causal graph, also known as a causal network or causal diagram, is a graphical representation of causal relationships between variables or events (Balashankar and Subramanian, 2021; Scholkopf et al., 2021). It is a visual tool used to depict cause-and-effect relationships and understand the causal structure of a system or phenomenon. In a causal graph, variables or events are represented by nodes, and causal relationships between them are depicted by directed edges or arrows. In Figure 8, we use causal graphs to illustrate multiple reasoning tasks mentioned above.\n' +

      '\n' +
      'Causal discovery (Peters et al., 2017) involves the task of identifying the causal graph (Long et al., 2022) that represents the underlying process responsible for generating observed data. LLMs have demonstrated competitive performance in discerning pairwise causal connections, although their effectiveness can vary and is influenced by the careful crafting of prompts. Long et al. (2022) investigate the limitations of GPT-3 in understanding causal relationships in the medical context. Within the framework of Neuropathic Pain Diagnosis (Tu et al., 2019), Tu et al. (2023) find that ChatGPT tends to make false negative mistakes. The performance of LLMs in causal discovery is not yet stable or consistent, and they may provide different answers to the same question, potentially due to internal model updates. Long et al. (2023) suggest that expert knowledge, including that of LLMs, may be incorrect. They propose leveraging imperfect experts, such as LLMs, to reduce uncertainty in the output of causal discovery algorithms. By incorporating the expertise of LLMs into the statistical analysis of objective data, they aim to improve the accuracy of causal structure learning. Advancing the current research on LLM-driven causal discovery, Ban et al. (2023) integrate knowledge-based LLM causal analysis with data-driven approaches to learning causal structures. They effectively combine the expertise of LLMs regarding existing causal mechanisms with the statistical analysis of objective data. They devise a specialized set of prompts aimed at deriving causal graphs from specific variables. By employing these prompts, they evaluate the impact of LLM-informed causality on deducing\n' +

      'CausLM (Feder et al., 2021) has demonstrated that language models like BERT (Kenton and Toutanova, 2019) can obtain a counterfactual representation of a particular concept of interest through the deliberate selection of auxiliary adversarial pre-training tasks. This counterfactual representation enables the prediction of the concept\'s actual causal effect on model\'s performance. On the other hand, Zhang et al. (2023a) believe that current LLMs can address causal questions by leveraging existing causal knowledge, akin to combined domain experts. However, these models still struggle to provide satisfactory answers when it comes to discovering new knowledge or performing high-stakes decision-making tasks with a high level of precision. Current LLMs lack the ability to incorporate actual physical data measurements to establish a grounding for their available textual facts (Zecevic et al., 2023; Willig et al., 2023). As a result, they are unable to engage in actual, inductive inference, similar to classical (causal) structure discovery methods. This limitation raises a crucial societal discussion point regarding the process of learning from facts. It is arguable that the ideal goal should be _understanding_ rather than mere _knowing_, as the latter lacks both generalization and justification.\n' +

For example, "If cats were vegetarians," followed by an imaginary consequence like "cats would love cabbage" (Li et al., 2023g). Counterfactual reasoning involves the consideration of hypothetical scenarios achieved by altering elements or conditions within an actual event or situation (Kahneman and Miller, 1986; Byrne, 2007). It plays a fundamental role in understanding causality, enabling us to explore the potential outcomes that could have arisen under different circumstances. By subjecting language models to counterfactual testing, we can manipulate the factual accuracy and hypothetical nature of statements, thereby evaluating the models\' capacity to discern and effectively utilize this information in making predictions. This testing approach enables us to gain insights into the models\' aptitude for differentiating between actual and hypothetical scenarios and their ability to leverage this understanding for accurate and contextually appropriate responses.\n' +

The world model encapsulates the conditions under which the function evaluation occurs, with the **default world** denoted as \\(w^{\\text{default}}\\).

      'Li et al. (2023) utilize counterfactual conditionals to examine the ability of pre-trained language models (PLMs) in distinguishing between hypothetical and real-world scenarios. They explore how this capability interfaces with the models\' utilization of pre-existing real-world knowledge and associative cues. Their findings reveal that when confronted with counterfactual situations, PLMs tend to generate completions that contradict established world knowledge. As an example, GPT-3 might have developed a nuanced comprehension of how linguistic cues, such as distinguishing between "If/had" and "Because," influence the connection between nearby lexical clues and the following words. This suggests that PLMs might prioritize the influence of immediate contextual cues over broader factual information when responding to counterfactual prompts. Wu et al. (2023) introduce an evaluation framework that incorporates "counterfactual" task variations. They present a set of 11 counterfactual tasks and assess the capability and performance of GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023), Claude (Anthropic, 2023), and PaLM-2 (Anil et al., 2023) on these tasks, considering both default and counterfactual conditions. The findings indicate that while current language models possess some degree of abstract task-solving abilities, their performance often relies on narrow, context-specific procedures that are not easily transferable across tasks. Notably, the models consistently exhibit a significant decrease in performance when confronted with counterfactual task variants compared to the default settings.

      'In the pursuit of developing Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), multimodal reasoning represents a promising advancement over unimodal approaches for several reasons. Firstly, multimodal reasoning aligns more closely with the way humans perceive the world. Humans naturally receive inputs from multiple senses, which often complement and cooperate with each other. As a result, leveraging multimodal information is anticipated to enhance the intelligence of Multimodal Foundation Models. Secondly, multimodal reasoning provides a more user-friendly interface. By incorporating support for multimodal input, users can interact and communicate with intelligent assistants in a more flexible, diverse and potentially more intuitive manner, improving the overall user experience. Thirdly, multimodal reasoning facilitates a more comprehensive problem-solving capability. While unimodal language models typically excel in natural language processing (NLP) tasks, Multimodal Foundation Models have the potential to support a broader spectrum of tasks, making them more versatile and effective as task-solvers. Key techniques and applications of Multimodal Foundation Models encompass various areas, including Multimodal Instruction Tuning (M-IT), which focuses on fine-tuning models based on multimodal instructions; Multimodal In-Context Learning (M-ICL), which leverages contextual information to enhance multimodal reasoning; and LLM-Aided Visual Reasoning (LAVR), which utilizes LLMs to enhance visual reasoning capabilities.

In a similar vein, BLIP-2 (Li et al., 2023f) adopts a strategy to facilitate efficient cross-modal alignment without fine-tuning the vision encoder. Instead, it introduces a Querying Transformer (Q-Former) that extracts visual features from a fixed image encoder. These extracted query embeddings serve as soft visual prompts for the alignment process.

      'Flamingo-80B (Alayrac et al., 2022) comprises a family of Visual Language Models (VLMs) equipped with in-context few-shot learning capabilities. These models undergo thorough evaluation across a wide array of tasks, including open-ended ones like visual question-answering and captioning, as well as closed-ended tasks such as multiple-choice visual question-answering. Frozen (Tsimpoukelli et al., 2021) accomplishes few-shot learning ability within a multimodal context by preserving the language capabilities of a Language Model (LM) while incorporating visual information as a prefix. Frozen achieves this by freezing the LM and training a separate vision encoder to represent images. In the Frozen approach, visual information is represented as a sequence of embeddings, serving as a visual prefix. MAGMA (Eichenberg et al., 2022) follows a similar approach to Frozen by incorporating a new image prefix encoder while keeping the language model frozen. It trains a series of Visual Language models capable of generating text autoregressively from combined visual and textual inputs. Visual ChatGPT (Wu et al., 2023) and GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023) represent advancements in extending chatbot capabilities to encompass multimodal applications that support both image and text prompts. Visual ChatGPT builds upon the foundation of ChatGPT and incorporates visual models. It incorporates a Prompt Manager that manages the histories of various visual foundation models, enabling a comprehensive multimodal conversation experience. On the other hand, GPT-4 takes a different approach by accepting prompts that consist of both images and texts. This flexibility empowers users to specify vision and language tasks by generating text outputs in response to arbitrarily interlaced text and image prompts. Microsoft has also proposed a series of Multimodal Foundation Models, including Kosmos-1 (Huang et al., 2023) and Kosmos-2 (Peng et al., 2023). These models further contribute to the development of multimodal capabilities and facilitate rich interactions involving both images and text.

Expanding on this foundation, LLaVA (Large Language and Vision Assistant) (Liu et al., 2023e) represents an extensively trained, large-scale multimodal model. It seamlessly integrates a vision encoder with Vicuna (Chiang et al., 2023), facilitating versatile visual and language comprehension for general-purpose applications. LLaVA excels across a diverse spectrum of tasks necessitating multimodal understanding, encompassing visual question-answering, image captioning, and instruction-following.

It tackles the challenge through a two-step process: first, translating the plot into text, and then performing reasoning over the translated text. The authors also investigate the combination of DePlot with LLMs to further enhance performance. MatCha (Math reasoning and Chart derendering pretraining) (Liu et al., 2023c) introduces a comprehensive framework for visual language understanding in the chart domain. It highlights the importance of two critical components: understanding layout, including number extraction and organization, and mathematical reasoning. To enhance visual language understanding, the authors propose two complementary pretraining tasks: chart derendering, which involves generating the underlying data table or code used to create a given plot or chart, and math reasoning.\n' +

It enables the automatic localization of objects of interest based on user-expressed desires, even in cases where the object is not explicitly mentioned. This innovative method incorporates reasoning capabilities to enhance the object detection process. Q-Bench (Wu et al., 2023c) demonstrates that the multimodal foundation models can perceive low-level visual attributes and provide image quality understanding. LLaMA-VID (Li et al., 2023s) enhances LLMs for more efficient video and image understanding. It represents each video frame with two tokens, which decreases the burden of processing long videos without sacrificing essential information.

      'Integrating diverse data types such as text, images, tables, and audio presents distinct challenges for multimodal foundation models compared to their unimodal counterparts. A primary obstacle lies in effectively merging these varied data formats, a task complicated by issues like inconsistency and incompleteness in datasets, where mismatches between image content and corresponding descriptions, or missing data,can adversely affect model performance. Additionally, multimodal foundation models typically demand substantial computational resources for training. Exploring efficient training methods for these models thus emerges as a valuable area of research, crucial for advancing the capabilities of multimodal AI systems.

      'Agent reasoning, is an important capability for the Autonomous Language Agents, which refers to a cognitive process that integrates perception, action, and interaction with the physical environment or simulated environment to support reasoning and problem-solving. Autonomous Agents in the context of Large Language Models have the ability to perform a wide range of tasks, such as task decomposition, generating code, answering questions, engaging in dialogue, providing recommendations, and more. Autonomous Agents, often known as AI Agents, harness the power of Large Language Models to autonomously perform tasks, utilizing their extensive knowledge, reasoning skills, and vast informational resources (Alibali et al., 2014).\n' +

      'Several works have investigated the use of language for planning purposes (Jansen, 2020; Li et al., 2022; Sharma et al., 2021; Zeng et al., 2023; Huang et al., 2022; Ahn et al., 2022; Mu et al., 2023; Hu et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2023a). Recent methods in task planning utilize pre-trained autoregressive foundation models to break down abstract, high-level instructions into executable, low-level step sequences for an agent, applying a zero-shot approach (Huang et al., 2022; Ahn et al., 2022). Specifically, Huang et al. (2022) prompt GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) and Codex (Chen et al., 2021) to create actions for agents, where each action step is semantically converted into a permissible action through Sentence-RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019; Reimers and Gurevych, 2019). In contrast, SayCan (Ahn et al., 2022) grounds the actions and language by combining the probability of each candidate action, as determined by FLAN (Wei et al., 2021), with the action\'s value function. The latter acts as a surrogate for measuring affordance (Shah et al., 2021). However, both approaches assume the successful execution of each proposed step by the agent, without considering potential intermediate failures in dynamic environments or accounting for the performance of lower-level policies. SwiftSage (Lin et al., 2023) is a framework influenced by the dual-process theory of human cognition, tailored for superior performance in action planning within intricate interactive reasoning tasks. This framework is structured around two main components: the SWIFT module and the SAGE module. The SWIFT module represents fast and intuitive thinking and is responsible for action planning based on the oracle agent\'s action trajectories. It is implemented as a small encoder-decoder language model that has been fine-tuned specifically for this purpose. On the other hand, the SAGE module emulates deliberate thought processes and utilizes LLMs such as GPT-4 for subgoal planning and grounding. This module leverages the power of language models to perform more sophisticated reasoning tasks within the framework. Another noteworthy approach in this regard is Reasoning via Planning (RAP) (Hao et al., 2023a), which capitalizes on the language model\'s dual role as both a world model and a reasoning agent. RAP incorporates a well-founded planning algorithm, specifically based on Monte Carlo Tree Search, to facilitate strategic exploration within the expansive realm of reasoning. The effectiveness of RAP is evaluated across various tasks, including plan generation, mathematical reasoning (e.g., GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021)), and logical reasoning (e.g., PrOntoQA (Saparov and He, 2023)). The evaluations demonstrate RAP\'s proficiency in addressing diverse reasoning challenges, effectively showcasing its versatility as a capable reasoning agent.\n' +

These capabilities are essential for the creation of intelligent systems that can successfully operate in complex and dynamic environments, seamlessly interact with humans, and engage in cooperative or competitive scenarios with other agents. We believe that combining foundational models with classical methods in robotics may create new opportunities, such as integrating classic approaches to perception (Chu et al., 2021), mapping (Pan et al., 2020), completing (Chu et al., 2023b), grasping (Li et al., 2021c), planning (Mao et al., 2023b), interaction (Jiao et al., 2020), and control.

      'PAL (Gao et al., 2023b) utilizes an LLM for the comprehension of natural language problems and the generation of intermediate reasoning steps in the form of executable programs. Nonetheless, the actual execution of solution steps is delegated to a programmatic runtime, such as a Python interpreter. This approach enables PAL to harness the language understanding capabilities of the LLM while making use of a distinct runtime environment for executing the generated programs. ProgPrompt (Singh et al., 2023) presents a structured LLM prompt akin to programming, crafted to facilitate the generation of plans in diverse situational settings, encompassing different robot functionalities and tasks. This structure involves prompting the LLM with program-style descriptions of accessible actions and objects in a given environment, along with sample programs for execution. Code-as-Policies (Liang et al., 2022a) introduces a robot-oriented framework for Language Model Generated Programs (LMPs). These LMPs are capable of depicting both reactive policies, like impedance controllers, and waypoint-oriented strategies. The versatility of Code-as-Policies is demonstrated across multiple real robot platforms, showcasing its applicability in diverse robotic scenarios.\n' +

      'Introspective reasoning, despite its simplicity, lacks the ability to adjust or modify a plan based on intermediate execution results. In contrast, retrospective reasoning operates by generating plans incrementally. As shown in Figure 12(b), it accomplishes this by iteratively interacting with the environment and incorporating feedback obtained from previous executions. Extrospective reasoning actively incorporates external information gathered through interactions with the environment. This allows retrospective reasoning to adapt and refine its plans based on real-time feedback and the observed outcomes of previous actions (Acay et al., 2007).\n' +

      'By actively engaging with the environment and utilizing feedback, retrospective reasoning offers a more flexible and responsive approach to generating plans, which is particularly suitable for complex and dynamic situations where the ability to adapt and learn from experience is crucial. Several related works in the field of retrospective reasoning with LLMs include Self-Ask (Press et al., 2023), ReAct (Yao et al., 2023c), ToolFormer (Schick et al., 2023), and LLM-Planner (Song et al., 2023a). Self-Ask (Press et al., 2023) proactively generates and responds to its own follow-up queries before addressing the original question. Meanwhile, ReAct (Yao et al., 2023c) leverages large language models to concurrently produce reasoning traces and task-specific actions. This dual approach enhances the interaction between these elements, with reasoning traces aiding in the development, monitoring, and modification of action plans, as well as managing unexpected situations. Conversely, actions facilitate the model\'s engagement with and acquisition of supplementary data from external entities like knowledge bases or environments. ToolFormer (Schick et al., 2023) is designed to intelligently determine the appropriate APIs to utilize, the timing for their invocation, the specific arguments to provide, and how to effectively integrate the obtained results into subsequent token predictions.

      'In addition to the above-mentioned research, Statler (Yoneda et al., 2023) provides a framework equipping LLMs with a persistent, memory-like representation of the world state. It utilizes two forms of general LLMs: a world-model reader and a world-model writer, both of which interact with and update the world state. This addition of a memory-like element to the framework significantly boosts the reasoning abilities of LLMs, allowing them to process information over extended time periods, free from the constraints typically imposed by context length limitations. The explicit representation of the world state empowers LLMs to retain and access relevant information, facilitating more comprehensive and contextually aware reasoning processes. Dasgupta et al. (2022) propose a collaborative system that combines the complementary reasoning abilities of LLMs. The system has three components: the Planner, the Actor, and the Reporter. The Planner is a pre-trained language model responsible for generating commands that guide the actions of a simple embodied agent, referred to as the Actor. The Reporter acts as a communication bridge between the Planner and the Actor, relaying relevant information to the Planner to inform its decision-making process for issuing subsequent commands. By harnessing the strengths of each component, this collaborative system aims to enhance the overall reasoning and decision-making capabilities of LLMs, allowing for more effective and context-aware interactions between language-based instructions and the embodied agent. Inner Monologue (Huang et al., 2022) investigates the capacity of LLMs to reason effectively in embodied contexts by leveraging natural language feedback without additional training. The authors propose that by incorporating environmental feedback, LLMs can develop an inner monologue that augments their capability to process and plan within robotic control scenarios.

This extensive dataset was collected over a period of 17 months using a fleet of 13 robots from Everyday Robots. RT-1 demonstrates promising properties as a scalable, pre-trained model, showcasing its ability to generalize based on factors such as data size, model size, and data diversity. The utilization of large-scale data collected from real robots engaged in real-world tasks contributes to RT-1\'s robustness and its potential for generalization in practical scenarios. Expanding upon the capabilities of RT-1, Robotic Transformer 2 (RT-2) (Brohan et al., 2023) further enhances the model\'s understanding of the world, resulting in more efficient and accurate execution of robotic tasks. By incorporating the chain of thought reasoning, RT-2 achieves multi-stage semantic reasoning abilities. This expansion equips RT-2 with a set of emerging capabilities derived from extensive training on a vast internet-scale dataset. Prominent advancements encompass a marked improvement in the model\'s ability to generalize to unfamiliar objects, the capacity to understand commands absent from its original training data, and the capability to engage in basic reasoning when responding to user instructions. These enhancements enhance RT-2\'s performance and broaden its capacity to tackle a more extensive array of tasks with increased sophistication. After that, RT-X (Padalkar et al., 2023) further extends RT-1 and RT-2 to cross-embodiment settings and shows better transferabilities and zero-shot capabilities.

If we aspire to have robot companions capable of collaborating with us, it is essential for them to possess the ability to understand and reason over both visual information and natural language input. The ultimate objective of creating smart robots is to enable them to act in a manner that is comparable to, or even surpasses, human capabilities (Xu et al., 2021).

The Hybrid Math Word Problems dataset (HMWP) (Qin et al., 2020) includes three types of math word problems extracted from a Chinese K12 math word problem bank. The dataset comprises 5,491 math word problems, categorized as follows: 2,955 one-unknown-variable linear MWPs, 1,636 two-unknown-variable linear MWPs, and 900 one-unknown-variable non-linear MWPs. Additionally, there is the DRAW1K dataset (Upadhyay and Chang, 2017), which contains 1,000 general algebra word problems. This dataset includes human-annotated derivations, which serve as information structures for problem-solving. The authors have also provided derivation annotations for over 2,300 algebraic word problems to facilitate future evaluations. They suggest evaluating solvers based on "derivation accuracy". Math23K-F and MAWPS-F (Liu et al., 2023) are datasets that provide high-quality, precise annotations of formula usage in each reasoning step for Math Word Problems. These datasets aim to enhance the understanding of how formulas are utilized throughout the problem-solving process. In conjunction with these datasets, the authors propose the Formulamastered Solver (FOMAS) system (Liu et al., 2023), which incorporates insights from the dual process theory and consists of two components: the Knowledge System and the Reasoning System. The former is responsible for learning and acquiring formula knowledge, while the latter leverages this knowledge to solve math word problems. This dual-component architecture enables FOMAS to leverage formula knowledge in the reasoning process effectively. The Academia Sinica Diverse MWP Dataset (ASDiv) (Miao et al., 2020) consists of 2,305 English math word problems (MWPs). The Math Word Problems (MWPs) in this dataset display a diverse range of textual patterns, encompassing the majority of problem types that are typically introduced in elementary education. Additionally, every problem within the collection is meticulously categorized based on its type and educational grade level, providing a clear indication of its difficulty level.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Existing MWP corpora can be categorized into four main groups: (1) Number Word Problem corpora, which contain problems related to numbers exclusively; (2) Arithmetic Word Problem corpora, which involve the four basic arithmetic operations and can be either single-step or multi-step problems; (3) Algebraic Word Problem corpora, which focus on algebraic MWPs; and (4) Mixed-type MWP corpora, which are large-scale collections of MWPs from daily algebra or GRE/GMAT examinations. SVAMP (Patel et al., 2021), is a collection of 1,000 math word problems (MWPs), created by introducing variations to initial examples from the ASDiv-A dataset. This compilation features 26 distinct equation models, with each problem incorporating an average of 1.24 operations. Although SVAMP\'s Corpus Lexicon Diversity (CLD) (Miao et al., 2020), falls short when compared to ASDiv-A, it presents a higher level of difficulty. The creators of SVAMP challenge the notion that lexical diversity is a definitive measure of quality in MWP datasets. SVAMP\'s target audience is students at the elementary school level.\n' +

While they excel in word recognition through semantic understanding, they struggle when it comes to perceiving combinations of characters lacking semantic meaning. Additionally, the models exhibit consistent performance regardless of text length and have limited capabilities in detecting intricate image details. Overall, the study concludes that even the most powerful existing multimodal models fall short compared to domain-specific methods in traditional text tasks. These findings underscore the necessity for innovative strategies to enhance zero-shot multimodal techniques and improve model performance in complex tasks.\n' +

      'Regarding evaluation benchmarks, Vedantam et al. (2015) contribute to the field by introducing two datasets: PASCAL-50S and ABSTRACT-50S. These datasets are designed for evaluating image caption generation methods. They serve as valuable resources that enable researchers to assess the performance and quality of image captioning models. By utilizing these datasets, researchers can advance image caption generation techniques, fostering progress and innovation in this area of research. LVLM-eHub (Xu et al., 2023) serves as a comprehensive and extensive evaluation benchmark for publicly available large multimodal models. It rigorously assesses the performance of eight LVLMs across six categories of multimodal capabilities. The evaluation process involves the utilization of 47 datasets and 1 arena online platform, providing a robust and standardized framework for evaluating LVLMs. Odouard and Mitchell (2022) present a concept-based approach to systematic evaluations, with a focus on assessing the proficiency of AI systems in utilizing a given concept across different instances. Their evaluation approach, as described in the cited work, entails conducting case studies within two specific domains: RAVEN, which is influenced by the Raven\'s Progressive Matrices (Raven and Court, 1938), and the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) (Acquaviva et al., 2021). These are frequently utilized for assessing and advancing the capacity for abstraction in AI systems. This methodology provides valuable information about the AI systems\' understanding and application of abstract reasoning abilities, shedding light on their ability to grasp and utilize concepts effectively. In a related study, Yin et al. (2023) expanded the research on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by incorporating point clouds. They introduced the LAMM-Dataset and LAMM-Benchmark, which specifically focus on improving 2D image and 3D point cloud understanding.\n' +

      'Hallucination is a well-known issue and has long been present in multimodal foundation models as well. Recent studies (Dai et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023) have investigated the performance of Visual Language Pretraining (VLP) models and Vision and Language Models (VLMs) in terms of object hallucination. Dai et al. (2023) discovered that despite advancements in VLP models, hallucinations remain a common issue. Interestingly, the study revealed that models with higher scores on conventional metrics like CIDEr (Vedantam et al., 2015) tended to exhibit more unfaithful results. The authors also found that patch-based features yielded the best results, with smaller patch resolutions reducing object hallucination. To tackle this issue, They proposed a straightforward yet effective VLP loss called Object Masked Language Modeling (ObjMLM) (Dai et al., 2023), which further mitigates object hallucination. By decoupling various VLP objectives, the authors demonstrated the importance of token-level image-text alignment and controlled generation in reducing hallucination. Similarly, Li et al. (2023) conducted evaluation experiments on representative VLMs and discovered widespread object hallucination issues. They also found that visual instructions can influence hallucination, with objects that frequently appear in the instructions or co-occur with image objects being more susceptible to hallucination by VLMs. Furthermore, the authors observed that existing evaluation methods may be influenced by the input instructions and generation styles of VLMs. To address this concern, they proposed an improved evaluation method called POPE (Polling-based Object Probing Evaluation) to assess object hallucination more effectively. Zhao et al. (2023) put forth a methodology for examining the robustness of open-source large VLMs in realistic and high-risk scenarios, where adversaries have limited black-box system access and aim to deceive the model into producing targeted responses. The authors begin by crafting targeted adversarial examples against pre-trained models like CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) and BLIP (Li et al., 2022). They later transfer these adversarial examples to other VLMs, including MiniGPT-4 (Zhu et al., 2023), LLaVA (Liu et al., 2023), UniDiffuser (Bao et al., 2023), BLIP-2 (Li et al., 2023), and Img2Prompt (Guo et al., 2023). The authors discovered that the effectiveness of targeted evasion in large VLMs can be significantly enhanced by employing black-box queries. This approach yields a surprisingly high success rate in generating targeted responses, thereby highlighting the vulnerability of these models to adversarial attacks. In addition, Huanget al. (2023c) introduce T2I-CompBench, a comprehensive benchmark for assessing text-to-image generation models\' capabilities in processing compositional prompts. It evaluates how these T2I models interpret and represent compositional concepts, such as attribute binding, object relationships, and complex compositions. T2I-CompBench also delves into effectively utilizing multimodal LLMs for evaluation in this context.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Regarding the metrics, DePlot (Liu et al., 2023b) introduces a metric called Relative Number Set Similarity (RNSS) for comparing table similarity. RNSS takes into account the table\'s structure and numeric values while remaining unaffected by column-n/row permutations. CIDEr, as introduced by Vedantam et al. (2015), is presented as an automated metric for the evaluation of image captioning.\n' +

      'In summary, these studies contribute to the development of innovative models, benchmarks, and evaluation metrics in the field of multimodal understanding. They explore various aspects of multimodal reasoning, including visual instruction-following, reasoning on charts, object detection, and image-related tasks. The proposed approaches and evaluations shed light on the strengths and weaknesses of existing models and highlight the need for further advancements in multimodal techniques.\n' +

      '\n' +
      'The realm of publicly accessible large-scale text datasets has seen a considerable expansion, presenting a rich variety of resources for myriad applications. A prime example is the Pile (Gao et al., 2020), an extensive English text corpus, notable for its impressive volume of 825 GB, and specifically curated to facilitate the training of large-scale language models. This corpus is comprised of 22 diverse subsets, recognized for their variety and quality, amalgamating both existing and newly created content, with a significant portion sourced from scholarly and professional domains. A considerable amount of this data is amassed through web crawling initiatives, akin to the Common-Crawl project. It is crucial to acknowledge that such web crawling produces a spectrum of content, from high-caliber material like Wikipedia entries to lower-tier content such as spam emails, necessitating rigorous filtering and processing to elevate data quality. Another notable dataset in this field is the C4 dataset (Raffel et al., 2019), representing an expansive and refined version of the Common Crawl web corpus, extensively utilized in various sectors. In contrast, the ROOTS dataset (Laurencon et al., 2022) emerges as an immense resource, encompassing 1.6TB and spanning 59 languages across 46 natural languages, derived from three macro regions and nine language families. It also includes material in 13 programming languages, with Java, PHP, and C++ comprising the majority of its content.

This community-led project integrates nine varied tasks, ranging from single-sentence/sentence-pair classifications to machine reading comprehension, all rooted in authentic Chinese text. Additionally, the Proof-Pile dataset Azerbayev et al. (2023), with its impressive 8 billion tokens, is notable in the mathematical text sphere. It is distinguished for being among the few open-source language models specifically tuned for the general mathematics field. The peS2o dataset Soldaini and Lo (2023), consisting of around 40 million open-access academic papers, is an invaluable asset. It has undergone thorough cleaning, filtering, and formatting, making it ideal for pre-training language models. Originating from the Semantic Scholar Open Research Corpus (S2ORC), it expands the availability of academic text resources. Furthermore, researchers have access to various public conversation datasets, like the Reddit corpus Roller et al. (2020). Data from online social media platforms also offers a wealth of conversational content. Scientific text collections typically focus on aggregating materials such as arXiv papers, scientific textbooks, mathematical websites, and related scientific materials. The complex nature of scientific data, often laden with mathematical symbols and protein sequences, requires specialized tokenization and preprocessing methods for standardization and uniform processing by language models. Recent research Austin et al. (2021) highlights the benefits of training Large Language Models (LLMs) on extensive code corpora, leading to marked enhancements in generated program quality. These corpora are often sourced from platforms like StackOverflow and GitHub. Lastly, the RedPajama project Computer (2023) deserves mention for its remarkable feat in reproducing LLaMA\'s training dataset, encompassing an impressive 1.2 trillion tokens. This dataset includes a vast array of tokens from CommonCrawl, C4, GitHub, Books, ArXiv, Wikipedia, and StackExchange, presenting a comprehensive and diverse resource for the development and refinement of language models.\n' +

(2021) has become a prevalent approach in developing transferable visual representations. This process is structured to create a linkage between an input image and a distinct label, each corresponding to a specific visual concept. With the growing need for large-scale pre-training, the generation of copious amounts of noisy labels from image-text pairings sourced from the World Wide Web has become increasingly relevant. Leveraging these noisy labels, numerous leading industrial research labs have skillfully assembled vast classification datasets using semi-automatic data pipelines. Notable examples of such endeavors include JFT Sun et al. (2017) and I2E Wu et al. (2023). Additionally, they have utilized proprietary data sources, such as Instagram hashtags Singh et al. (2022), to enrich their datasets further and augment the precision of their pre-trained models. This strategy has significantly contributed to the advancement of sophisticated visual recognition systems, equipping them with the ability to effectively identify and categorize a wide spectrum of visual concepts and objects.\n' +

SBU (Ordonez et al., 2011), for instance, executes an extensive number of Flickr queries and then rigorously filters the results to produce 1 million images, each paired with a caption that is visually pertinent. Conversely, RedCaps (Desai et al., 2021) is a substantial dataset encompassing 12 million image-text pairs, sourced from Reddit. The WIT dataset (Srinivasan et al., 2021) is distinguished by its curated compilation of 37.6 million image-text instances, enhanced with entity information, covering 108 Wikipedia languages, and incorporating 11.5 million unique images. Other relatively large datasets in this field include Shutterstock (Nguyen et al., 2022), LAION-400M (Schuhmann et al., 2021), and COYO-700M (Byeon et al., 2022). OpenAI\'s CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) was refined through an impressive collection of 400 million image-text pairs, meticulously sourced from the web. Recently, the emergence of datasets at the billion-scale level has been observed. The LAION-5B dataset (Schuhmann et al., 2022), for instance, comprises 5.85 billion CLIP-filtered image-text pairs, of which 2.32 billion are in the English language. DataComp (Gadre et al., 2023) functions as a platform for dataset experiments, focusing on a new pool of 12.8 billion image-text pairs collected from Common Crawl. Flamingo (Alayrac et al., 2022) introduces the MultiModal MassiveWeb (M3W) dataset, aggregating text and images from about 43 million web pages, and aligning images with text according to the Document Object Model (DOM). A noteworthy project in this context is ImageBind (Girdhar et al., 2023), which aims to develop a joint embedding covering six distinct modalities, including images, text, audio, depth, thermal, and IMU data, with potential extension to other modalities such as point clouds (Guo et al., 2023). This ambitious endeavor signifies a major step forward in fostering a deeper comprehension of multimodal data by establishing meaningful links across diverse data types. As multimodal learning advances, these developments in dataset creation and application are crucial to the ongoing innovation in the field.\n' +

      'The significance of code and paper data in enhancing the reasoning abilities of foundation models is paramount. Discussing code data first, research by CoCoGen (Madaan et al., 2022) indicates that when structured commonsense reasoning tasks are approached as code generation problems, pre-trained language models (LMs) for code exhibit superior reasoning capabilities compared to those trained on natural language. This holds true even for tasks that do not involve source code. Such code data are readily accessible on GitHub and through various filtered datasets available to the public. Highlighting this, StarCoder (Li et al., 2023) has released an extensive pretraining dataset (783GB) to further refine LMs\' proficiency in coding. In terms of paper data, Galactica (Taylor et al., 2022) stands out, having been trained on a vast corpus of scientific papers, reference material, knowledge bases, and other diverse sources. This model demonstrates superior performance across a spectrum of scientific tasks compared to existing models. Paper data primarily originates from academic platforms like Arxiv, with a notable emphasis on mathematics papers. Additionally, the peS2o (Soldaini and Lo, 2023) dataset, encompassing over 40 million open-accessacademic papers from the Semantic Scholar Open Research Corpus (S2ORC), provides a substantial resource for the pretraining of models.\n' +

      '\n' +
      'The foundation model architecture is essential. We discuss different network architectures in the following and show them in Figure 15.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Encoder-decoder ArchitectureThe seminal Transformer model, as delineated by Vaswani et al. (2017), is founded on the encoder-decoder framework. This paradigm employs dual stacks of Transformer blocks, wherein one functions as the encoder and the other as the decoder. The encoder phase involves utilizing multi-head self-attention layers in a stacked arrangement to decode the intrinsic information within the input sequence, thereby yielding latent representations. In the subsequent phase, the decoder applies cross-attention mechanisms to these representations, facilitating the generation of the target sequence. This innovative architecture is extensively applied in sequence-to-sequence modeling tasks, such as neural machine translation. In a distinctive approach, BERT (Kenton and Toutanova, 2019) is engineered for the pretraining of deep bidirectional representations from the unlabeled text. It uniquely processes both left and right contexts concurrently across all layers, rendering it exceptionally versatile for a plethora of NLP tasks. Conversely, BART (Lewis et al., 2020) incorporates a conventional Transformer-based architecture for neural machine translation. While its structure may appear straightforward, BART can be regarded as an evolution of BERT, amalgamating the bidirectional encoder of BERT and the unidirectional, left-to-right decoder of GPT, along with other advanced pretraining methodologies. Furthermore, Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) following the encoder-decoder architecture paradigm, exemplified by T5 (Raffel et al., 2019), have consistently showcased remarkable performance across a wide array of NLP tasks.\n' +

      'The decoder-only architecture is characterized by its strategic use of an attention mask, a pivotal element that ensures each input token is exclusively attentive to preceding tokens, including itself. This unique configuration facilitates a unidirectional flow of information from antecedent tokens to the current token within the decoder, thereby streamlining the processing of input and output tokens. This approach not only simplifies the learning mechanism but also bolsters the model\'s coherence and consistency. In the domain of language modeling, the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) series epitomizes the decoder-only architecture. This series encompasses GPT-1 (Radford et al., 2018), GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019), and the notably advanced GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020). GPT-3, in particular, serves as a quintessential model within this paradigm, exemplifying the architectural efficacy, especially in in-context learning, a distinguishing feature of Large Language Models (LLMs). The decoder-only architecture\'s influence transcends the GPT lineage, significantly impacting the broader field of LLMs. Numerous cutting-edge language models have adopted this architectural framework as their foundational structure. For instance, OPT (Zhang et al., 2022) employs the decoder-only architecture to achieve commendable natural language understanding capabilities. Gopher (Rae et al., 2021) also leverages this unidirectional flow to escalate the complexity and scale of language modeling tasks. Moreover, the decoder-only architecture has been instrumental in the evolution of models like BLOOM (Scao et al., 2022), which utilize its unidirectional information flow for tasks necessitating contextual comprehension. LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023) and its successor, LLaMA-2 (Touvron et al., 2023), have integrated this architectural style to propel advancements in language modeling, achieving remarkable performances across various NLP benchmarks. GLM (Zeng et al., 2022) further underscores the decoder-only architecture\'s efficacy in a range of language understanding tasks, underscoring its vital role in the contemporary landscape of language modeling.\n' +

      '#### CLIP Variants\n' +
      '\n' +
      'CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) employs an innovative approach by simultaneously training an image encoder and a text encoder to infer the correct pairings among a set of \\(<\\)image, text\\(>\\) pairs. This strategy forms the bedrock of its learning process. In contrast, FILIP (Yao et al., 2021) enhances alignment at a finer granularity by incorporating a cross-modal late interaction mechanism. This mechanism employs token-wise maximum similarity measurements between visual and textual tokens to provide guidance for the contrastive objective, resulting in more precise alignments. FLIP (Li et al., 2023) introduces a groundbreaking training technique that involves randomly masking and removing a significant portion of image patches. This approach increases the number of image-text pairs that can be learned within the same wall-clock time, enabling more samples to be contrasted per iteration without significantly increasing memory usage. On the language encoder side, K-Lite (Shen et al., 2022) suggests incorporating external knowledge in the form of Wiki definitions for entities in combination with their original alt-text for contrastive pre-training. Empirical evidence indicates that enriching text descriptions in this manner leads to improved CLIP performance. LaCLIP (Fan et al., 2023) leverages the in-context learning ability of large languagemodels to rewrite text descriptions for their associated images, further enhancing the model\'s performance by aligning descriptions more effectively with the visual content. DetCLIP, as introduced in Yao et al. (2022), represents a pioneering approach in parallel visual-concept pre-training for open-world detection. It leverages knowledge enrichment from a meticulously crafted concept dictionary. Meanwhile, its successor, DetCLIPv2 (Yao et al., 2023) capitalizes on the maximum word-region similarity between region proposals and textual words to steer the contrastive objective.\n' +

      '#### Other Architectures\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Traditional Transformer architectures are often limited by their quadratic computational complexity. To address this, recent research has focused on developing more efficient language modeling architectures. The S4 model (Gu et al., 2021) offers an innovative solution by applying a low-rank correction to condition the state matrix, thus stabilizing its diagonalization and reducing the complexity of the state space model (SSM) to operations akin to a Cauchy kernel. Similarly, GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) emerges as a compelling alternative to the S4 and DSS (Gupta et al., 2022) models, with the advantage of markedly faster training times. In contrast, H3 (Dao et al., 2022) is designed to excel in specific functions like recalling earlier tokens in the sequence and comparing tokens across the sequence, further enhancing its efficiency through the integration of FlashCov. For those exploring subquadratic alternatives to attention mechanisms, Hyenra (Poli et al., 2023) offers a notable solution. This model is crafted by combining implicitly parametrized long convolutions with data-controlled gating, significantly diminishing computational requirements. RWKV (Peng et al., 2023) utilizes a linear attention mechanism, allowing the model to function as either a Transformer or an RNN. This approach not only facilitates parallelized computations during training but also ensures constant computational and memory complexity during inference, marking it as the first non-transformer architecture scalable to tens of billions of parameters. RetNet (Sun et al., 2023) represents another significant contribution, striking an optimal balance between training parallelism, cost-effective inference, and robust performance. LongNet (Ding et al., 2023) introduces dilated attention, a technique that significantly widens the attention field as the distance between tokens increases, thereby enabling effective scaling of sequence length to over a billion tokens. Lastly, Streaming-LLM (Xiao et al., 2023) presents an efficient framework that allows Language Models (LLMs) trained with a finite-length attention window to adapt to infinite sequence lengths without additional fine-tuning. This breakthrough has extended the sequence length capability of these models to 4 million tokens.\n' +

      '\n' +
      'A fundamental strategy employed by Large Language Models (LLMs) revolves around the concept of pre-training on extensive general domain data, followed by customizing the model to suit particular tasks or domains. This approach endows LLMs with a comprehensive understanding of language patterns, enabling them to subsequently fine-tune their performance across a broad spectrum of downstream tasks, includingnatural language understanding, generation, and translation. The process of adaptation assumes paramount significance in achieving exceptional results in these specific tasks, as it empowers the LLM to leverage its previously acquired knowledge and apply it to new instances. The adaptation process encompasses a variety of techniques, ranging from thorough fine-tuning of the pre-trained model to the incorporation of task-specific layers or modules, as well as the utilization of transfer learning methods like knowledge distillation.\n' +

      'A natural step in the process of data collection entails the adaptation of pre-existing NLP benchmarks. Given that these benchmarks are open-source, researchers find it both more convenient and cost-effective to utilize reasoning benchmarks to bolster the model\'s reasoning capabilities. However, challenges arise concerning the availability of benchmarks in terms of quantity and scale, and the manual creation of new benchmarks proves to be a resource-intensive task. To tackle this issue, researchers are devising strategies to generate fine-tuning data for reasoning synthesis using an advanced language model.\n' +

      '_Synthesis Data_\n' +
      '\n' +
      'This section delves into the synthesis of reasoning data utilizing advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) and subsequently harnesses the generated data for fine-tuning. The core of this research revolves around the application of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques to LLMs, leading to the creation of reasoning paths. Subsequently, the generated data is leveraged for the model fine-tuning (Fu et al., 2023; Hsieh et al., 2023; Huang et al., 2022; Li et al., 2022; Magister et al., 2023). Additionally, the Finetune-CoT method, as introduced by Ho et al. (2022), involves the sampling of multiple reasoning paths from LLMs, which are then used for fine-tuning student models with the correct ones. The Distilling step-by-step approach, proposed by Hsieh et al. (2023), introduces a novel mechanism with two primary objectives: (a) training smaller models surpassing LLMs and (b) achieving this feat with reduced training data requirements for fine-tuning or distillation. Furthermore, the Self-Improve approach, as detailed in Huang et al. (2022), includes the selection of rationale-augmented answers with the highest confidence for unlabeled questions using Chain-of-Thought prompting and self-consistency. Subsequently, the LLM is fine-tuned using these self-generated solutions as target outputs, with the additional step of feeding the question and ground-truth label to LLMs to prompt their reasoning path. An alternative approach involves leveraging several examples with human-written explanations as demonstrations of LLMs, followed by the generation of explanations for the training set (Li et al., 2022). Notably, this research provides evidence supporting the feasibility of fine-tuning a student model based on the chain of thought outputs generated by a larger teacher model, resulting in improved task performance across various types of reasoning datasets, including arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning (Magister et al., 2023). In the domain of mathematics, the WizardMath framework (Luo et al., 2023), introduces a novel method termed Reinforcement Learning from Evol-InstructFeedback (RLEIF). This approach initially generates diverse math instruction data using math-specific Evol-Instruct. Subsequently, it involves the training of an instruction reward model (IRM) and a process-supervised reward model (PRM) (Yuan et al., 2023; Lightman et al., 2023). The IRM assesses the quality of the evolved instruction, while the PRM receives feedback for each step in the solution. Furthermore, MetaMath (Yu et al., 2023) introduces an innovative question bootstrapping method (such as forward-backward augmentation (Jiang et al., 2023)) to augment the training dataset, resulting in MetaMathQ. This method entails the rewriting of questions with both forward and backward reasoning paths and utilizes LLMs to rephrase the question text. Lastly, MAmmoTH, as introduced by Yue et al. (2023), presents a new math hybrid instruction-tuning dataset named MathInstruct. This dataset boasts two significant characteristics: extensive coverage of diverse math fields and complexity levels, as well as the incorporation of hybrid Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Process-of-Thought (PoT) rationales. The paper "Orca" by Mukherjee et al. (2023) introduces a method called explanation tuning. This approach involves fine-tuning a model using pairs of queries and responses. The responses are augmented with detailed explanations from GPT-4, clarifying the teacher model\'s reasoning process as it generates each response. In a subsequent work, "Orca2" by Mitra et al. (2023), a technique named Prompt Erasing is proposed. This method involves modifying the training process by replacing the specific instructions provided to the student system with generic ones, omitting specific details about how to execute the task.\n' +

      '\n' +
      'One of the fundamental paradigms in building foundation models entails thorough pre-training on general domain data, succeeded by customization for specific tasks or domains. As model sizes continue to grow, conducting comprehensive fine-tuning that alters all model parameters becomes progressively unfeasible. Hence, the importance of parameter-efficient fine-tuning in efficiently refining foundation models cannot be emphasized enough. Some representative approaches of different types of techniques are shown in Figure 16.\n' +

      '#### Adapter Tuning\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Adapter tuning, a technique that employs specialized neural network modules called "adapters" within Transformer models, is discussed in Houlsby et al. (2019). An innovative adaptation method, LLaMA-Adapter (Zhang et al., 2023), has been developed to effectively fine-tune LLaMA models for instruction-following tasks. LLaMA-Adapter showcases its efficiency by introducing only 1.2 million learnable parameters into the pre-trained LLaMA 7B model, utilizing 52,000 self-instruct demonstrations, and completing the fine-tuning process in under an hour using 8 A100 GPUs. MAD-X (Pfeiffer et al., 2020) is an adapter-based framework which is designed to learn modular language and task representations that can be adapted to various tasks and languages with high portability and transfer of high parameter-efficiency. On the other hand, AdaMix (Wang et al., 2022) fine-tunes a mixture of adaptation modules in each transformer layer while keeping the majority of PLM weights frozen. Compacter (Karimi Mahabadi et al., 2021) integrates task-specific weight matrices into the weights of a pre-trained model, which can be efficiently obtained as a sum of Kronecker products between shared "slow" weights and "fast" rank-one matrices as defined in each Computer layer. Lastly, He et al. (2021) introduce a unified framework that establishes connections between these approaches.\n' +

      'Low-Rank AdaptationLow-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) (Hu et al., 2022), shown in Figure 16(a), offers a distinctive approach aimed at reducing the number of trainable parameters in pre-trained Transformer models when applied to downstream tasks. This technique involves the\n' +

The figure credits from LoRA (Hu et al., 2022). (b) Prompt tuning incorporates trainable prompt vectors at the input layer and uses the prompt-augmented input to tackle specific downstream issues. (c) SSF only needs to scale and shift the deep features extracted by a pre-trained network for parameter-efficient fine-tuning. The figure credits from SSF (Lian et al., 2022).

      'freezing of pre-trained model weights and the introduction of trainable rank decomposition matrices into each layer of the Transformer architecture. While low-rank decomposition has limitations in terms of representation power, KronA (Edalati et al., 2022) opts for the Kronecker product as an alternative to low-rank representation. AdaLoRA (Zhang et al., 2023) parametrizes incremental updates through singular value decomposition, allowing for the effective pruning of unimportant singular values. DyLoRA (Valipour et al., 2022) adopts an alternative method, focusing on training LoRA blocks across a spectrum of ranks instead of just one. This is done by organizing the representations acquired by the adapter module at different ranks throughout the training process. For those in search of an efficient fine-tuning solution, "Efficient Fine-tuning of Quantized LLMs" (QLoRA) (Dettmers et al., 2023) provides an appealing option. QLoRA enables the fine-tuning of models with up to 65 billion parameters on a single 48GB GPU, making it a practical and accessible choice for both researchers and practitioners. To enable more complex reasoning tasks, LongLoRA (Chen et al., 2023) offers a novel method to expand the input context sizes of large language models while maintaining computational efficiency and performance integrity.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Prompt TuningPrefix tuning, initially introduced in Li and Liang (2021), extends Transformer-based language models by appending a sequence of trainable continuous vectors, known as "prefixes" to each layer. It lays the foundation for prompt tuning, a concept akin to "prefix tuning" (Lester et al., 2021), with a primary focus on integrating trainable prompt vectors exclusively at the input layer. Prompt tuning represents a simple yet highly effective approach for obtaining "soft prompts" that empower fine-tuned language models to excel in specific downstream tasks, e.g., classification (Yang et al., 2022), which has been illustrated in Figure 16(b). In a similar context, OptiPrompt (Zhong et al., 2021) operates within the continuous embedding space to optimize performance. On the other hand, P-tuning (Liu et al., 2023) leverages trainable continuous prompt embeddings alongside discrete prompts, demonstrating effectiveness across both pre-trained and fine-tuned language models, whether in fully supervised or few-shot settings. An evolution of this concept, P-tuning V2 (Liu et al., 2021), proposes the integration of continuous prompts into every layer of the pre-trained model, not restricting itself solely to the input layer. This extension provides a comprehensive approach to harnessing continuous prompts throughout the model\'s architecture.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Partial Parameter TuningIn contrast to the aforementioned approaches that emphasize parameter efficiency, partial parameter tuning distinguishes itself by not introducing any additional components but rather by selectively fine-tuning specific parameters within the original model. Bitfit (Zaken et al., 2021) exemplifies this concept as a method for sparse fine-tuning, concentrating solely on adjusting the bias terms of the model. ChildTuning (Xu et al., 2021) adopts a strategic approach to parameter adaptation. It targets a subset of parameters known as the "child network" within large pre-trained models while carefully masking out gradients from the non-child network during the backward pass. In the case of SSF (Lian et al., 2022), corresponding to Figure 16(c), the method introduces learnable parameters in training. These extra parameters can be seamlessly integrated into the original pre-trained model weights through re-parameterization at inference, with modifications applied to either the complete set or a subset of these parameters. DiffFit (Xie et al., 2023), on the other hand, presents a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy tailored for large pre-trained diffusion models. This method enables rapid adaptation to new domains by fine-tuning bias terms and incorporating newly introduced scaling factors into specific layers of the model. Fu et al. (2023) theoretically analyze the parameter sparsity in fine-tuning approaches and design SAM to optimize the selection of suitable parameters.\n' +

      'Luo et al. (2023, 2023) have developed a pioneering method for fine-tuning vision-language models, termed Mixture-of-Modality Adaptation (MMA). Illustrated in Figure 16(d), MMA serves as a comprehensive optimization framework that unifies the image encoder with Large Language Models (LLMs) via efficient adapters. This work also introduces a cutting-edge routing algorithm in MMA, enabling the model to dynamically modify its reasoning pathways for both single- and multimodal instructions. Utilizing MMA, the authors have created LaVIN (Luo et al., 2023), a significant vision-language instructed model that exhibits enhanced training efficiency and improved reasoning abilities across a range of instruction-following tasks. LaVIN demonstrates superior performance compared to existing multimodal LLMs. The MMA methodology and LaVIN model hold considerable potential in augmenting the utility of vision-language models, particularly in applied fields like robotics and autonomous systems. In a similar context, LLaMA-Adapter V2 (Gao et al., 2023) represents a visual instruction model that focuses on parameter efficiency and the seamless integration of visual information. This model incorporates several strategies to boost its performance, including expanding its learnable parameter set, adopting an early fusion approach to integrate visual tokens into the initial layers of LLMs, and applying a joint training approach for both image-text pairings and instruction-following datasets. Alternatively, LLaVA (Liu et al., 2023) presents itself as an integrated multimodal model that undergoes an end-to-end training process. LLaVA links a vision encoder and an LLM to process a wide spectrum of tasks involving both vision and language comprehension. LLaVA-1.5 (Liu et al., 2023) introduces relatively straightforward adjustments, like utilizing CLIP-ViT-L-336px with an MLP projection and integrating task-specific VQA data with basic response formatting prompts. These modifications enable LLaVA-1.5 to set a robust baseline performance, achieving top-tier results across 11 benchmark tasks.\n' +

      'The methodology of alignment training introduces an innovative approach that employs learning techniques to optimize language models using human feedback directly. This concept has initiated a new paradigm in which language models are fine-tuned to correspond with intricate human values more closely. While Large LanguageModels (LMs) can be prompted to execute a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks based on given examples, they often manifest unintended behaviors. These include generating fictitious information, creating biased or offensive text, or failing to comply with user directives. Such discrepancies stem from the divergence between the traditional language modeling objective--predicting the next token from the web-based text--and the goal of "following user instructions in a manner that is both helpful and safe." This incongruuity suggests a misalignment in the language modeling objective. Rectifying these unintentional behaviors is critically important, especially given the widespread application of language models in numerous domains.\n' +

      'A common method for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) to more accurately interpret and respond to human intentions through specific guidance is known as Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). This technique involves processing an instructional input, labeled as \\(x\\), and then calculating the cross-entropy loss in relation to the actual correct response, denoted as \\(y\\). The main role of SFT is to assist LLMs in understanding the deeper meanings within text prompts and to produce appropriate replies. However, a significant drawback of SFT is its lack of capacity to make detailed distinctions between the best and less ideal responses. Overcoming this challenge necessitatesadditional training strategies, such as incorporating human preference training.The overall training pipeline is presented in Figure 17.\n' +

      'Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)(Ouyang et al., 2022) represents a strategy developed to interpret human preferences by incorporating additional reward models within the framework of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)(Schulman et al., 2017). RLHF is divided into three primary phases: 1) The initial stage includes the creation of a comprehensive set of guidelines and the application of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on pre-existing Large Language Models (LLMs); 2) The next phase involves human evaluators who manually grade pairs of responses, aiding in the development of a reward model that evaluates the effectiveness of the responses generated; 3) Lastly, the SFT model (policy) undergoes refinement through PPO, leveraging the rewards determined by the reward model.\n' +

      'While the PPO framework is known for its effectiveness in learning human preferences, it can present challenges and exhibit less stability during training. An alternative approach, Reward Ranked Fine-Tuning (RAFT) (Dong et al., 2023), initially involves sampling a substantial batch of instructions. Subsequently, responses are generated by the current LLMs, and the resulting data is ranked using a reward model. Only the top instances, as determined by the reward model, are then used for SFT. Additionally, Advantage-Induced Policy Alignment (APA) (Zhu et al., 2023) employs a squared error loss function based on estimated advantages, offering an alternative perspective on policy alignment within the RLHF framework.\n' +

      'thousands of feed-forward sub-networks and employs a selective mechanism to engage a sparse array of these experts for each data instance. This methodology culminates in a model with an astounding 137 billion parameters, assigning a singular expert to every example. The model achieves sparsity through a gating function that directs each input to the top-\\(K\\) experts, where \\(K\\) is at least 2. Expanding upon this concept, GShard (Lepikhin et al., 2020) adapts the MoE paradigm for transformers by substituting each feed-forward layer with a pairwise MoE layer, equipped with a Top-2 gating network. In a different approach, Switch Transformers (Fedus et al., 2022) refine the MoE\'s sparsity by selecting either the optimal experts or a single best expert (where \\(K\\) equals 1) for each input. Additionally, GaLM (Du et al., 2022) leverages a sparsely activated MoE architecture to amplify model capacity while substantially reducing training costs compared to denser models. The largest variant of GaLM boasts a remarkable 1.2 trillion parameters, significantly surpassing GPT-3 in scale. MoE has also been effectively implemented to enhance the capabilities of vision models (Chen et al., 2023, 2022). Moreover, MoE finds application in network compression strategies. WideNet (Xue et al., 2022) represents a parameter-efficient method that utilizes parameter sharing for compression along the network\'s depth. To optimize modeling capacity, WideNet scales the model\'s width by replacing standard feed-forward networks with a MoE structure and incorporating distinct layer norms to effectively process diverse semantic representations. MoEBERT (Zuo et al., 2022) adopts a similar strategy, transforming the feed-forward neural networks in a pre-trained model into multiple experts. This modification maintains the robust representational abilities of the pre-trained model while integrating layer-wise distillation during training. In inference, a single expert is activated to optimize performance.\n' +

      '### In-Context Learning\n' +
      '\n' +
      'As described in Brown et al. (2020), In-Context Learning (ICL) is a method that utilizes a meticulously crafted natural language prompt encompassing both the task description and a subset of task examples to provide demonstrations. This process commences with the task description, followed by the careful selection of a few examples from the task dataset to serve as demonstrations. These chosen instances are then intricately arranged into natural language prompts using thoughtfully designed templates. Subsequently, the test instance is combined with these demonstrations as input for Language Models or Vision-Language Models (Chen et al., 2023) to generate the desired output. Leveraging the provided task demonstrations, LLMs can effectively discern and execute novel tasks without the need for explicit gradient updates. It is important to note that ICL shares a fundamental connection with instruction tuning, as both methods use natural language to structure tasks or instances. Nevertheless, instruction tuning necessitates the fine-tuning of LLMs to adapt models, whereas ICL relies purely on prompting LLMs for their applications. Moreover, it\'s important to note that instruction tuning can improve the ICL abilities of LLMs for executing specific tasks, particularly in zero-shot situations where only task descriptions are provided (Chung et al., 2022). A diverse set of common techniques are introduced next and listed in Figure 19.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '#### 4.5.1 Demonstration Example Selection\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The effectiveness of In-Context Learning (ICL) often exhibits considerable variability based on the choice of demonstration examples. Therefore, it becomes crucial to carefully select a subset of examples that can truly harness the ICL capacity of Language Models (LLMs). Two primary methods for demonstration selection are prevalent: heuristic approaches and LLM-based approaches, as explored in the works of Liu et al. (2022) and Lee et al. (2022).\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Prior-Knowledge Approach** Due to their cost-effectiveness and simplicity, heuristic techniques have been widely adopted in previous research for the selection of demonstrations. Many studies have integrated k-NN-based retrievers to identify semantically relevant examples for specific queries, as evidenced by Liu et al. (2022) and Lee et al. (2022). However, it is important to note that these approaches typically operate on a per-example basis, lacking a holistic evaluation of the entire example set. To overcome this limitation, diversity-centric selection strategies have been introduced to curate a subset of examples that collectively represent the spectrum of specific tasks, as explored in the works of Levy et al. (2022) and Hongjin et al. (2022). Moreover, research conducted by Ye et al. (2022) takes into account both relevance and diversity in the demonstration selection process. Intriguingly, Complex CoT (Fu et al., 2022)\n' +

      'advocates the inclusion of intricate examples that involve extensive reasoning steps, while Auto-CoT (Zhang et al., 2022c) suggests the sampling of a more diverse set of examples for demonstration.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Retrieval Approach** Another area of research is dedicated to harnessing the capabilities of Language Models (LLMs) in selecting demonstrations. For instance, LLMs can be employed to directly assess the informativeness of each example by quantifying the performance improvement resulting from its inclusion, as demonstrated by Li and Qiu (2023a). In a related vein, Rubin et al. (2022) introduce an approach called EPR, which involves a two-stage retrieval process. Initially, EPR recalls similar examples through an unsupervised method and subsequently ranks them using a dense retriever. Building upon this, Dr.ICL (Luo et al., 2023e) applies the EPR approach to a broader spectrum of evaluation tasks, encompassing QA, NLI, MathR, and BC. Within the context of in-context learning, Compositional Exemplars for In-context Learning (CEIL) (Ye et al., 2023a) utilizes Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs) to learn the interaction between input and in-context examples. This model is optimized using a well-crafted contrastive learning objective. Additionally, LLM-R (Wang et al., 2023k) adopts a ranking method for retrieved candidates, relying on the conditional LLM log probabilities of the ground-truth outputs. It employs a cross-encoder-based reward model for capturing fine-grained ranking signals from LLMs, and a bi-encoder-based dense retriever trained through knowledge distillation. The Unified Demonstration Retriever (UDR) (Li et al., 2023n) utilizes a shared demonstration retrieval model to overcome the issue of non-transferability among retrievers across different tasks. UDR ranks candidate examples based on LLM\'s feedback. With trained retrievers, DQ-LoRe (Xiong et al., 2023a) utilize Dual Queries and Low-rank approximation Re-ranking to automatically select exemplars for in-context learning.\n' +

      '#### Chain-of-Thought\n' +
      '\n' +
      '_Zero-Shot CoT_\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Zero-shot CoT (Kojima et al., 2022) introduces a novel approach to enhance model reasoning abilities by incorporating additional sentences. For instance, empirical evidence has demonstrated that including the phrase "Let\'s think step by step" can significantly boost the model\'s reasoning skills. In a similar vein, Plan-and-Solve (PS) Prompting (Wang et al., 2023j) presents a two-fold strategy. First, it involves formulating a plan to break down the overall task into smaller, manageable subtasks. Subsequently, these subtasks are executed according to the devised plan. More precisely, PS prompting replaces the original "Let\'s think step by step" from Zero-shot CoT with a new prompt that encourages a more detailed approach: "Let\'s first understand the problem and devise a plan to solve it. Then, let\'s proceed to execute the plan and solve the problem step by step."\n' +

      '_Few-Shot CoT_\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Chain-of-Thought (CoT) (Wei et al., 2022b) has charted a significant course for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Language Models (LLMs) by employing detailed reasoning paths as prompts. This directional trend has given rise to various CoT variants, such as least-to-most (Zhou et al., 2022a), complex CoT (Fu et al., 2022),program-of-thought (Chen et al., 2022d), equation-of-thought (Liu et al., 2023k), program-aid-language (Gao et al., 2023b), mathprompter (Imani et al., 2023), and code prompting (Hu et al., 2023b). However, it is worth noting that all these methods require annotations, which impose practical limitations on their application. To address this constraint, Auto-CoT (Zhang et al., 2022c) proposes a novel approach that utilizes Zero-Shot-CoT (Kojima et al., 2022) to generate CoT reasoning paths. Furthermore, Auto-CoT divides these reasoning paths into different clusters and selects questions that are most closely aligned with the centroid of each cluster. Memory-of-Thought (Li and Qiu, 2023b) selects relevant, high-quality thoughts from external memory during the reasoning process. Taking a step further, Tree-of-Thought (Yao et al., 2023b) models the human thought process not only as a chain but also as a tree, whereas Graph-of-Thought (Yao et al., 2023d) extends this concept to represent human thought processes as both chains and graphs. Additionally, Skeleton-of-Thought (Ning et al., 2023) guides LLMs to first create the basic structure of the answer and then uses batched decoding to simultaneously fill in the details of each skeleton.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '#### Multiple Paths Aggregation\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The DIVERSE approach (Li et al., 2022h) employs a voting verifier to consolidate final answers derived from multiple reasoning paths. In a similar vein, the Self-Consistency method (Wang et al., 2023s) suggests sampling multiple reasoning paths and making a majority vote to determine the ultimate results. Building on this direction, the concept of complexity-based voting has been introduced, retaining reasoning paths with high complexity for majority voting (Fu et al., 2022). Furthermore, Model Selection (Zhao et al., 2023d) takes a different approach by sampling two answers via Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Plan-of-Thought (PoT) and then employing a Language Model (LLM) to select the correct one. Instead of generating complete reasoning paths, Self-Evaluation Guided Decoding (Xie et al., 2023c) samples various reasoning steps at the step level and utilizes beam search to complete the search tree. One notable limitation of Self-Consistency is its relatively high cost. To mitigate this drawback, Adaptive-Consistency (Aggarwal et al., 2023) progressively samples reasoning paths until predefined criteria are met. Two concurrent approaches related to Tree-of-Thought (Yao et al., 2023b; Long, 2023) gradually sample reasoning steps rather than complete reasoning paths. Additionally, Reasoning via Planning (RAP) (Hao et al., 2023a) repurposes the LLM as both a world model and a reasoning agent. It incorporates a principled planning algorithm, based on Monte Carlo Tree Search, to facilitate strategic exploration within the extensive reasoning space. Exchange-of-Thought (Yin et al., 2023c) and X-of-Thoughts (Liu et al., 2023k) introduce a variety of external reasoning insights and reasoning methods to enhance reasoning performance.\n' +

      '#### Learned Refiners\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The Learned Refiner necessitates a training process, and the acquisition of supervised refinement typically involves pairs of feedback and refinement (Schick et al., 2022; Du et al., 2022; Yasunaga and Liang, 2020; Madaan et al., 2021). CURIOUS (Madaan et al., 2021) initially constructs a graph that represents relevant influences. This graph is then integrated as an additional input for responding to the question. PEER (Schick et al., 2022) is an advanced collaborative language model that replicates the entire writing process, encompassing drafting, suggesting modifications, proposing edits, and providing explanations for its actions. In contrast, Read, Revise, Repeat (R3) (Du et al., 2022) aims to achieve superior text revisions with minimal human intervention. It achieves this by analyzing model-generated revisions and user feedback, making document revisions, and engaging in repeated human-machine interactions. DrRepair (Yasunaga and Liang, 2020) introduces a program feedback graph that connects symbols relevant to repairing source code with diagnostic feedback. It then employs a graph neural network to model the reasoning process. Self-Correction (Welleck et al., 2022) takes an innovative approach by decoupling an imperfect base generator, such as a standard language model or supervised sequence-to-sequence model, from a separate corrector. This corrector learns to refine outputs progressively. Furthermore, LLM-Augmenter (Peng et al., 2023) continuously enhances LLM prompts to improve model responses by incorporating feedback generated by utility functions, such as the factuality score of an LLM-generated response.\n' +

      'The REFINER framework (Paul et al., 2023) is a comprehensive system designed to fine-tune Language Models (LMs) with the specific goal of generating intermediate reasoning steps, aided by a critic model that automates feedback on the reasoning process. The Self-Refine framework (Madaan et al., 2023) comprises two vital components: it first generates an output using an LLM and then employs the same LLM to provide feedback on its output through an iterative self-refinement process. Self-Debugging (Chen et al., 2023) integrates both LLM and tool feedback to enhance performance. Similarly, Progressive-Hint Prompting (PHP) (Zheng et al., 2023) utilizes previous answers as references for generating subsequent responses. Furthermore, employing distinct prompts for LLMs allows for the assignment of different roles in handling various aspects (Dong et al., 2023; Fu et al., 2023; Du et al., 2023). Du et al. (2023) introduce a complementary approach to enhance language responses, involving multiple instances of language models engaging in discussions about their individual responses and reasoning processes over multiple rounds to arrive at a shared final answer. Self-collaboration (Dong et al., 2023) utilizes multiple LLMs as distinct "experts", each responsible for specific subtasks within complex assignments, defining strategies for collaboration and interaction. Fu et al. (2023) observe that only a subset of the considered language models demonstrate proficiency in self-improvement through AI feedback, as weaker models may struggle with understanding game rules or incorporating AI feedback for further enhancements. In conclusion, models exhibit varying abilities to learn from feedback based on their roles, and interactions betweenLLMs and tools can further enhance reasoning performance (Chen et al., 2023; Gou et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023; Olaussson et al., 2023).\n' +

      '## 5 Discussion: Challenges, Limitations, and Risks\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Foundation models have shown promising capabilities in reasoning tasks, opening up new possibilities for the field. It is also essential to acknowledge the challenges, limitations, and risks associated with their use.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '_Hallucinations_\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Despite the promising progress made in foundation models, it is important to acknowledge that these models still face challenges, specifically in relation to the issue of hallucinations (Li et al., 2023; Mundler et al., 2023). Hallucination refers to the generation of outputs by foundation models that contain fabricated or incorrect information, deviating from the intended or expected outputs. These hallucinations can be problematic, as they undermine the reliability and accuracy of the model\'s generated content.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The hallucination problem in foundation models arises due to various factors. One key factor is the reliance on large-scale pre-training data, which can contain biased or erroneous information. This can lead to the model learning and propagating false patterns or generating unrealistic outputs. Another significant factor contributing to the hallucination issue in foundation models is the models\' lack of ability to acknowledge their own knowledge limitations. When confronted with questions beyond their understanding, these models tend to fabricate seemingly plausible answers instead of admitting their lack of knowledge (Yin et al., 2023).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Addressing the hallucination problem in foundation models is an ongoing area of research. Techniques such as fine-tuning task-specific data, incorporating external knowledge sources, and developing advanced evaluation metrics have been explored to mitigate hallucinations. Researchers are also exploring methods to enhance reasoning capabilities in foundation models, enabling them to make more informed and accurate predictions.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'It is worth noting that while progress has been made in reducing hallucinations, completely eliminating them remains a challenge due to the inherent complexity of language understanding and generation.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Context LengthAnother limitation is to optimize context length and context construction. For example, GPT models start with 2K window size (GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020)) and go all the way to 32K (GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023)). A longer context window is useful for working with long sequence data, such as gene sequences. By having a larger context window, LLM is capable of handling more lengthy inputs such as entire documents, or comprehending the full scope of an article. This ability enables LLM to produce more contextually relevant responses by leveraging a more comprehensive understanding of the input.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Increasing the context window size in foundation models can bring several benefits, such as capturing longer-range dependencies and improving the model\'s understanding of context. However, it also comes with certain challenges and costs. In earlier studies, it was observed that the costs associated with larger context window sizes exhibited a quadratic increase as the number of tokens grew (Aryan et al., 2023). This means that the computational resources required to process and train the models become significantly higher as the window size grows. LongNet (Ding et al., 2023) represents a modified version of the Transformer model, capable of handling sequences exceeding 1 billion tokens in length, while still maintaining its effectiveness on shorter sequences. LongNet also has a linear computation complexity. Position Interpolation (Chen et al., 2023) implements a linear downscaling of input position indices to align with the initial context window size during inference. This approach prevents extending beyond the context length trained for, which might otherwise result in abnormally high attention scores and interfere with the self-attention mechanism.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Indeed, while increasing the context window size in language models offers benefits, it is important to consider the tradeoff between window size and generalization ability. Researchers have highlighted that there can be a tradeoff between them (Liu et al., 2023). One challenge worth exploring is how to increase the context window length without sacrificing the model\'s performance and generalization capabilities. It is crucial to find strategies that allow models to capture longer-range dependencies and context while maintaining their ability to generalize well to new or unseen inputs.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Multimodal LearningMultimodal learning is an incredibly powerful but often underappreciated aspect of reasoning. It finds applications in numerous fields where multimodal data is essential, including healthcare (such as CT, X-ray, MRI scans, and gene sequences), robotics, e-commerce, retail, gaming, and entertainment. The integration of different modalities in these domains enables a more comprehensive understanding of the data and facilitates more sophisticated reasoning processes.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'One of the key advantages of multimodal reasoning is its potential to significantly improve model performance. While some prior works have delved into multimodal reasoning, such as the multimodal language Model for embodied reasoning proposed by PaLM-E (Driess et al., 2023) and the visual language model for fear-shot learning known as Flamingo (Alayrac et al., 2022), there is still ample room for exploring additional data modalities. Incorporating modalities like video, audio, 3D data, and multiple images not only enriches the information available to the models but also opens up exciting possibilities for a more nuanced and comprehensive understanding of the world. Other potential applications of foundation model reasoning lie in the domain of Electronic Design Automation (EDA) for program design (Huang et al., 2021) and Formal Methods (Woodcock et al., 2009).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Formal methods, intrinsically linked to logical reasoning, are mathematical strategies employed in the realm of computer science for the design, specification, verification, and analysis of both software and hardware. These techniques are anchored in structured logic, the theory of automata, and other comprehensive mathematical frameworks. They are used to meticulously examine the behavior, accuracy, and dependability of systems. The utilization of formal methods empowers researchers and professionals to guarantee the integrity and precision of intricate systems, establishing them as indispensable in the creation and assessment of software and hardware. The amalgamation of formal methods with foundational models opens doors to augmenting reasoning abilities in the design of software and hardware systems. Formal methods bring to the table precise mathematical methods for defining and confirming system characteristics, whereas foundational models contribute potent language comprehension and reasoning skills. The synthesis of these methodologies can foster the development of more dependable and resilient software and hardware systems.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'By leveraging multimodality reasoning and further expanding the exploration of various data modalities, we can unlock new insights and capabilities in reasoning systems. It is crucial to recognize and harness the power of multimodal reasoning to fully exploit the potential of reasoning in diverse domains.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '#### Efficiency and Cost\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Efficiency and cost are significant challenges for foundation models for reasoning. Foundation models, especially those with large architectures and extensive training data, can be computationally expensive to train and deploy. The large number of parameters requires more memory and computational resources for processing. This poses challenges in terms of scalability, accessibility, and cost-effectiveness. Efficient reasoning models should be capable of performing fast and real-time inference to meet the demands of interactive applications. However, the complex computations involved in reasoning tasks can lead to slower inference times, hindering real-time performance and user experience. Therefore, it is crucial to enhance the speed and cost-effectiveness of foundation models, making them cheaper and faster.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'There are several techniques that can be employed to improve the efficiency of foundation models, including:\n' +
      '\n' +
      '* Model Pruning (Sun et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2020): removing unnecessary connections, parameters, or layers from the model. This results in a more compact architecture, reducing computational requirements.\n' +
      '* Compression (Zhu et al., 2023) and Quantization (Tao et al., 2022): reduce the size of the model or reduce the precision of model parameters, using fewer bits to represent them. This reduces memory usage and computational complexity.\n' +
      '* Knowledge Distillation (Gu et al., 2023): training a smaller model (student) to mimic the behavior and predictions of a larger model or ensemble of models (teacher). This transfer of knowledge allows for efficient inference with reduced computational resources.\n' +
      '* Low-Rank Factorization (Ren and Zhu, 2023; Hsu et al., 2022): replace high-dimensional tensors with lower-dimensional tensors. By reducing the number of parameters, these methods improve efficiency without significant loss in performance.\n' +

      'By employing these techniques, it is possible to enhance the efficiency of foundation models, making them faster and more cost-effective for various reasoning tasks and applications.\n' +

      '#### Human Preference\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Addressing the risks and potential harms associated with foundation models, such as bias, unfairness, manipulation, and misinformation, requires careful consideration and proactive measures. One approach is to focus on improving learning from human preference and feedback to ensure more responsible and accurate model behavior.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'To mitigate these risks, we can explore several strategies. First, we need mechanisms to incorporate diverse perspectives and mitigate bias during the training and fine-tuning phases of foundation models. This can involve diverse data collection, representative sampling, and careful annotation processes that involve input from a wide range of human perspectives. Continual learning and adaptation, informed by human feedback, can also play a crucial role. By enabling ongoing interactions between models and human annotators or users, we can gather feedback and iteratively refine the models\' behavior. This iterative process helps identify and rectify potential biases, unfairness, or misinformation, allowing the models to improve over time. Furthermore,ensuring that the outputs of foundation models align with real-world evidence, experimental findings, and explicit knowledge is essential. This requires incorporating robust fact-checking mechanisms and validation processes into the model training pipeline. Additionally, leveraging external sources of information, such as trusted databases or expert knowledge, can help verify and validate the outputs generated by the models.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Constitutional AI, as proposed by Bai et al. (2022), offers an approach that involves both supervised learning and reinforcement learning phases like "RL from AI Feedback" (RLAIF). Similarly, Bakker et al. (2022) explore the use of fine-tuning a large language model (LLM) with 70 billion parameters to generate statements that maximize the expected approval for people with different and diverse perspectives. This approach emphasizes the importance of incorporating human preferences and diverse viewpoints during the model training process.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'By integrating these techniques and approaches, we can work towards mitigating the risks and potential harms associated with foundation models. Improving learning from human preference, continual learning informed by feedback, and ensuring fidelity to real-world evidence are challenging steps in building more responsible and trustworthy reasoning systems.\n' +

      '#### Multilingual Support\n' +
      '\n' +
      'While reasoning itself is a language-agnostic process, the availability of comprehensive knowledge sources is often limited to a few languages, primarily English. Historically, language foundation models have demonstrated exceptional reasoning performance, primarily in English, with relatively limited support for other languages such as Chinese and Japanese. Currently, there is a lack of robust multilingual reasoning language foundation models that excel across various languages.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Fang et al. (2022) propose utilizing English as a pivot language in their commonsense reasoning framework. They employ a translate-retrieve-translate (TRT) strategy, leveraging English knowledge sources to enhance their reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, Huang et al. (2023) introduce cross-lingual thought prompting (XLT) as a systematic approach to improving the multilingual capabilities of Language and Reasoning Models (LLMs).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Given these advancements, there is a growing interest in developing foundation models dedicated to multilingual reasoning. Building robust models that excel in multilingual presents an intriguing avenue for future research and development.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In summary, to address these challenges, ongoing research and development efforts are necessary. This includes advancing the deployment of reasoning models.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '## 6 Future Directions\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Further research and development in this area have the potential to unlock even more advanced reasoning abilities in foundation models.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### Safety and Privacy\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The rise of foundation models and their application to reasoning tasks has highlighted the critical need to ensure their safety and trustworthiness (Huang et al., 2023).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Various intended attacks have been identified, including the robustness gap (Shreya and Khapra, 2022), backdoor attacks (Shen et al., 2021; Kurita et al., 2020), poisoning (Carlini et al., 2023), disinformation (Nelson et al., 2008), privacy leakage (Li et al., 2023), and unauthorized disclosure of information (Perez and Ribeiro, 2022). Specifically, backdoor attacks involve the injection of malicious knowledge into foundation models through techniques such as poisoning the training data (Shen et al., 2021) or modifying model parameters (Kurita et al., 2020).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'As one of the most principled techniques for training machine learning models with privacy, differential privacy allows for training on datasets without revealing any details of individual training examples, providing enhanced privacy protection (Shi et al., 2022; Behnia et al., 2022). Another effective way of defensing adversarial attacks is by adversarial training, which can provide another layer of security when facing malicious yet human invisible perturbations added in model inputs (Li et al., 2023; Li and Spratling, 2023).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In response to some copyright concerns, Kirchenbauer et al. (2023) introduce a watermarking framework specifically designed for proprietary language models. This framework enables the embedding of watermarks with minimal impact on text quality and facilitates their detection using an efficient open-source algorithm, eliminating the need for accessing the language model API or parameters.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### Interpretability and Transparency\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Additionally, there is a need for increased transparency and interpretability of foundation models (Liao and Vaughan, 2023). As these models become more complex and sophisticated, understanding their reasoning processes and the factors influencing their outputs becomes increasingly important.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Sometimes, foundation models generate toxic content, which may incite violence and cause infordemic (Bender et al., 2021; Weidinger et al., 2021). They can inadvertently disclose sensitive information, thereby jeopardizing privacy and security. Additionally, LLMs can contribute to the dissemination of misinformation, both intentionally and unintentionally (Pan et al., 2023; Buchanan et al., 2021; Kreps et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2023). The complex and uncertain nature of foundation models further compounds these challenges. These models exhibit a remarkable capacity to perform a wide range of tasks across diverse contexts (Bommasani et al., 2021). However, their massive and opaque architectures hinder a comprehensive understanding of their capabilities and behaviors, making it difficult to ascertain their decision-making processes and potential biases. This lack of transparency raises concerns regarding model interpretability, control, and accountability.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Developing techniques and frameworks for model interpretability can help address concerns regarding transparency and accountability.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### Autonomous Language Agents\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The capacity for logical reasoning is crucial in achieving complex tasks in embodied environments, and it plays a significant role in embodied intelligence (Dasgupta et al., 2022). Foundation Models have exhibited powerful capabilities for reasoning and flexibility through the process of in-context learning (Yang et al., 2023). Recent studies, such as Voyager and DEPS, have explored the use of LLMs for planning in Minecraft (Wang et al., 2023, 2023). DEPS specifically proposes an interactive planning approach based on LLMs (Wang et al., 2023). LLMs have also shown promise in generating action sequences directly based on natural language instructions without requiring extra domain knowledge (Li et al., 2022). Equipping embodied agents with commonsense knowledge is crucial for their successful completion of complex human instructions in diverse environments (Wu et al., 2023).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In the context of reasoning for autonomous agents, there are key characteristics:\n' +
      '\n' +
      '* Infinite Task Capability: Foundation models empower agents with the capacity to handle an extensive range of tasks, even those that are not pre-defined or anticipated in advance. This flexibility allows agents to dynamically generate tasks based on their understanding of the context and the specific needs of the users.\n' +
      '* Autonomous Task Generation: Foundation model reasoning enables agents to autonomously generate new tasks within a given context. This capability empowers agents to take initiative, identify opportunities, and propose relevant tasks to users. They can adapt and respond to changing circumstances, making them more versatile, proactive, and efficient in fulfilling user requirements.\n' +
      '* Value System: Autonomous agents are driven by a value system empowered by a pre-trained foundation model, which serves as the foundation for task generation. This value system guides the agent\'s decision-making process, taking into account factors such as priorities, preferences, and ethical considerations. By leveraging the capabilities of the foundation model, agents can make informed decisions aligned with human values, ensuring responsible and ethical behavior.\n' +
      '* World Model: The foundation model can also be utilized as a world model that represents the real world and serves as the basis for agents\' interactions and reasoning. This comprehensive model enables agents to understand the context, interpret natural language inputs, and generate appropriate responses or actions. With the foundation model as their world model, agents can effectively navigate and operate within their environment, enhancing their ability to interact intelligently and respond to user needs.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'By leveraging foundation models, autonomous agents can facilitate more meaningful and effective interactions with users, better understand their intents and needs, and generate relevant tasks accordingly. This approach opens up promising avenues for research in areas such as contextual understanding, human-like reasoning, and personalized assistance. Ultimately, it enhances the overall user experience and enables the development of more sophisticated and intelligent AI systems.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Given their reasoning capabilities, Foundation Models hold significant potential for applications in human-computer interaction and embodied intelligence. can be leveraged to create interactive and adaptive systems that can dynamically respondto user input and adapt their behavior accordingly. This involves developing models that can learn from user interactions and update their knowledge and behavior over time. By enabling Foundation Models to actively engage with users and adapt to their preferences and needs, we can create more personalized and user-centric human-computer interaction experiences.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### Reasoning for Science\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Future work can also build upon the research on temporal reasoning in multimodal question-answering tasks or sound reasoning (Brandt and McClure, 2011), as demonstrated by Audio Question Answering (AQA) (Fayek and Johnson, 2019). Researchers can delve deeper into understanding and developing foundation models that can reason and make inferences based on auditory information. This can have implications in areas such as audio-based decision-making systems, environmental monitoring, and audio scene understanding.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Furthermore, the application of multimodal reasoning can be extended to domains like medical reasoning and diagnosis, particularly in the context of gene sequence analysis. This can aid in the identification of genetic disorders, personalized medicine, and the exploration of potential treatments.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Overall, future work can focus on advancing multimodal reasoning abilities in foundation models. These endeavors can contribute to the development of more intelligent and context-aware systems in various fields.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### Super Alignment\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Superintelligence alignment, according to OpenAI1, is the next machine-learning question of utmost importance. However, ensuring the control and alignment of potentially superintelligent AI systems poses significant challenges. Current techniques, such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), heavily rely on human supervision and reasoning. As AI systems surpass human intelligence, human supervision becomes inadequate, necessitating new scientific and technical breakthroughs in alignment research. Existing alignment techniques will not scale to superintelligence due to the limitations of human reasoning and supervision. The prospect of controlling and steering highly intelligent AI systems to prevent them from going rogue remains an unsolved challenge. Without reliable means of supervising these reasoning systems surpassing human capabilities, ensuring their alignment with human intent becomes increasingly difficult.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Footnote 1: [https://openai.com/blog/introducing-superalignment](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-superalignment)\n' +
      '\n' +
      'One approach to address the challenge of ensuring that reasoning systems surpassing human intelligence adhere to human intent is to develop a roughly human-level automated alignment researcher. By creating such a system, it becomes possible to leverage extensive computational resources to scale alignment efforts and iteratively align superintelligence.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '## 7 Conclusion\n' +
      '\n' +
      'This survey illuminates the evolutionary path of foundation models in the field of reasoning, showcasing a discernible progression in complexity and efficacy from their initial stages to current advancements. While we acknowledge the remarkable strides made in data-driven thinking, it is crucial for us to objectively recognize both the strengths and limitations of large models. Emphasizing the importance of enhancing their interpretability and security becomes imperative in this context. We also note that with all the papers surveyed in this work, a consensus is yet to be reached on how to push forward the reasoning ability of foundation models to a consistently superhuman level (which can for instance win an IMO medal or even solve open mathematical problems).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In conclusion, while foundation models offer exciting possibilities in reasoning tasks, it is essential to approach their development and application with a critical perspective. It is crucial to acknowledge the challenges, limitations, and risks associated with LLM-based reasoning. By doing so, we can foster responsible and thoughtful advancements in this field, ensuring the development of robust and reliable reasoning systems.\n' +
