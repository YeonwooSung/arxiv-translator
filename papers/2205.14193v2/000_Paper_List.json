        "abstract": "Active optical metasurfaces are rapidly emerging as a major frontier in photonics research, development, and commercialization. They promise compact, light-weight, and energy-efficient reconfigurable optical systems with unprecedented performance and functions that can be dynamically defined on-demand. Compared to their passive counterparts, the reconfiguration capacity of active metasurfaces also set additional challenges in scalable design, manufacturing, and control toward their practical deployment. This perspective aims to review the state-of-the-art of active metasurface technologies and their applications while highlighting key research advances essential to enabling their transition from laboratory curiosity to commercial reality.",
